"Mock elections can play an extremely valuable role in helping young people understand how the democratic process works and why it matters," he said.Michael Rafferty, who is mock elections project manager at the Hansard Society, said he looked forward to seeing schools and colleges across the UK participating in the mock votes.The Y Vote initiative is being run jointly by the Electoral Commission, the Hansard Society and the Department for Education and Skills in the run-up to local elections and the general election, possibly on 5 May.Mock elections are planned to take place in schools across the UK.
Search giant Google launched its desktop search tool in October, while Yahoo is planning to release similar software in January.The desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded with firms touting programs that help people find files.Google has already released a desktop tool.Microsoft has entered the desktop search fray, releasing a test version of its tool to find documents, e-mails and other files on a PC hard drive.Microsoft's program can be used as a toolbar on the Windows desktop, the Internet Explorer browser and within the Outlook e-mail program.
Mr Blair has probably been closer to President Bush than any other European leader.Mr Chirac denied there was any snub - he is going to a memorial service for the United Arab Emirates' late leader and says he would be happy to meet Mr Allawi.Mr Blair is at a summit in Brussels, where Iraq and European justice and immigration plans are on the agenda.Tony Blair is urging European leaders to wake up from their "state of denial" over President Bush's re-election.He woke up at 0530GMT to discover Mr Bush had won but declined to say if he was pleased with the eventual result.America needed to listen to the world too, he said.French President Jacques Chirac reacted to his warning by saying Europe instead needed to reinforce its own unity.Mr Blair recently said the UK would only participate in EU-wide measures where it was in UK interests but the Tories say he is surrendering a key veto.The French president told reporters: "Europe today has more than ever the need, the necessity, to reinforce itself and its dynamism and unity.His words about President Bush met a cool reception from Jacques Chirac.
The figures confounded hopes of a 0.2% expansion in the fourth quarter in Europe's biggest economy.Germany's economy shrank 0.2% in the last three months of 2004, upsetting hopes of a sustained recovery.The ECB's mandate is to fight rising prices by boosting interest rates - and that could further threaten Germany's hopes of recovery.It said growth in the third quarter had been zero, putting the economy at a standstill from July onward.Germany has been reliant on exports to get its economy back on track, as unemployment of more than five million and impending cuts to welfare mean German consumers have kept their money to themselves.
Fifth seed Robin Soderling took the Milan Indoors title with a dramatic win over Radek Stepanek in Sunday's final.A change in approach from fourth seed Stepanek in the second set paid dividends as he took it on a tie-break, but Soderling's superior power proved too much in the third.The 20-year-old Swede edged the final set tie-break for a 6-3 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-5) victory and his second tour title after winning in Lyon last year.
Wales coach Mike Ruddock says England lock Danny Grewcock needs to review his actions after he kicked Dwayne Peel."The referee's interpretation was that Grewcock was attempting to step over the ruck.""If the ball is at the back of the ruck and I feel I can step over and disrupt it then I will do that," said Grewcock."It's up to the citing commissioner," said Ruddock."Our first aim was to get Gavin settled into the team, but it's something we'll talk about in selection this week," said Ruddock.Grewcock was sin-binned with Wales captain Gareth Thomas for retaliation.The player himself and his captain Jason Robinson have both said that the clash with Peel was accidental.Last June Grewcock was banned from rugby for two months for reckless use of a boot in a match against New Zealand.
Mr Wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap.Choking traffic jams in Beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.The trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them.Indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.Indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure."The price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable," said Wang Yan, an official from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Development and Reform quoted in the state-run China Daily newspaper.
The service uses 3GP technology, one of the standards for mobile TV.A service from the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation lets people watch TV programmes on their mobiles 24 hours a day."Mobile phone music services must not be positioned to compete with the PC music experience as the handsets are not yet ready," said Thomas Husson, mobile analyst at Jupiter research.A separate study by Gartner has also said real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles is "unlikely" in Europe until 2007.Mobile TV will have to overcome several barriers before it is widely taken up though, said the report.Despite moves to bring music download services to mobiles, people do not want to trade multimedia services with size and battery life, said Jupiter.Various standards and ways of getting TV signals to mobiles are being worked on globally.But, the Gartner report on mobile TV broadcasting in Europe suggests direct broadcasting will have to wait.But at the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) formally adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the mobile TV broadcasting standard for Europe.Digital video recorders, like Europe's Sky+ box, and video-on-demand services mean people have much more control over what TV they watch.In the US, services like TiVo To Go let people transfer pre-recorded TV content onto their phones.People are also likely to be put off watching TV on such small screens, said Gartner.TV services will have to live up to the expectations of the digital TV generation too, which expects good quality images at low prices, according to analysts.
A CRE spokesman said the organisation had nothing to add on the shortlist issue specifically but would be working with all the political parties to address the under-representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament.If ethnic minorities were represented in the House of Commons in proportion to their numbers in the population, there would be 42 ethnic minority MPs.Ethnic minorities make up 8% of the United Kingdom population but only 2% of MPs - 13 out of 659 - are from a visible minority group."I think all-black shortlists are the only way to cut to the chase and address the lack of minority candidates," Mr Vishwanathan said.Ashok Vishwanathan of Operation Black Vote, which aims to increase ethnic minorities' participation in the political process and their representation, said the result again showed all-women shortlists were not effective in getting minority women selected.An Operation Black Vote spokesman said they now wanted to meet Labour party chairman Ian McCartney for discussions.
Vivancos slashed his personal best to equal the Spanish record with a time of 7.60secs while Kronberg and Dorival clocked 7.62secs and 7.63secs respectively.He won his heat in 7.64secs but ran 0.04secs slower in his first IAAF Indoor Grand Prix circuit final."It was definitely a learning curve and I certainly haven't ruled out challenging for a medal next week," said the East Kilbride athlete.Scott was slightly disappointed with his run in the final.The race was won by Felipe Vivancos, who equalled the Spanish record.
The first cards would be issued in 2008 and, when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.Mr Clarke, writing in The Times, accused some critics of "liberal woolly thinking and spreading false fears" by claiming ID cards would erode civil liberties."If you were running a family or a business would you have the second reading of the Identity Cards Bill tomorrow or would you pause to reflect and see what you might do about it in the New Year?Mr Clarke is expected to try and win over opponents to the scheme by saying officials who secretly accessed information they were not allowed to see would face up to two years in jail.Charles Clarke faces his first real test as home secretary on Monday with a possible backbench rebellion over the controversial ID cards bill.Mr Clarke, who took on the post on Thursday after David Blunkett quit, has rejected calls to "pause" on the bill.Critics argue that introducing the cards would be a costly scheme with no specific aim.The new bill would also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents.He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration.
Referee Graham Poll said he applied the laws of the game in allowing Arsenal striker Thierry Henry's free-kick in Sunday's 2-2 draw with Chelsea."Referees have been told to ask the player 'do you want to take the quick free-kick?'Don was head of the referees for the Premier League and revealed all clubs were informed of free-kick options.He said 'can I take it please?'Keeper Petr Cech was organising his defensive wall when Henry's quick free-kick flew in, which angered Chelsea.Henry told BBC Radio Five Live: "The ref asked me if I wanted 10 yards or if I wanted to take it straight away and I said that I wanted to take it straight away.He said to me, 'go'.I said 'yes'," said Poll."We spoke to all the Premier League clubs as well as all the Football League clubs in the summer of 2003 explaining what the situation was," he added "We gave them the option of either the quick free-kick or the 'ceremonial' free-kick.On this occasion it was Arsenal," Don told BBC Radio Five Live.I asked Henry 'do you want a wall?'.
"Wolf Brother is an enchanting book," he said.Paver is currently writing the second book in the series.It was published in 2004, with Paver earning an advance of $5m (£2.8m) - the highest sum ever paid for a debut children's book."Michelle Paver lives and breathes the worlds she writes about," said a spokesman for the author.Wolf Brother tells the story of Torak, a 12-year-old hunter who lives in the forest."I've told her about the film deal but at the moment she is writing the second book and her mind is 6000 years away deep in the primeval forest."
Notwithstanding, comedian Reeves remains 3/1 favourite to win the show, after Pasquale.Comic Joe Pasquale remains odds on favourite to win the reality show.Bookmakers Ladbrokes says the singer has even odds of being the first contestant to be voted off the show."It's going to be close but Sheila is favourite as she has shown herself to be a bit of a troublemaker," said Ladbrokes' Warren Lush.On Friday, Ladbrokes suspended betting after singer Brian Harvey quit the show folllowing a blazing row with Janet Street-Porter.
G Thomas (capt); H Luscombe, T Shanklin, G Henson, S Williams; S Jones, D Peel; G Jenkins, M Davies, A Jones; B Cockbain, R Sidoli; J Thomas, M Williams, M Owen.Wales regained control with a second try in the 21st minute, Henson lobbing up a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin jumped higher than Nitoglia to dot down his 15th Test try.Fly-half Stephen Jones added four conversions as Wales maintained their superb start to this year's tournament.Henson sent Luscombe streaking away and when he off-loaded to Martyn Williams, the flanker showed his nous to ground the ball against the padding of the post, Jones adding the conversion.Jones was unable to convert and De Marigny then hit the upright with a penalty attempt for Italy.Before Italy could recover from that blow, a strong surge from Gareth Thomas and great off-loads from Martyn Williams and replacement Kevin Morgan saw Shane Williams scamper over.But Wales put the outcome beyond doubt with two superb tries in four minutes before the hour.The icing on the cake came with a sixth try after more superb support work, Shane Williams and Ceri Sweeney combining to send Sidoli over in the left corner.Luciano Orquera did reply with one for Italy but second-half efforts from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams and Robert Sidoli sealed victory.But a clever high kick from Henson almost brought a try for Hal Luscombe when Roland de Marigny and Ludovico Nitoglia made a hash of claiming it as the ball bounced into touch.Wales twice threatened further scores but failed to find the crucial pass, and Italy hit back out of the blue in the 11th minute.The only downside for Wales was a hamstring injury suffered by Luscombe.Their fourth after 53 minutes was sparked by another mazy run from Shane Williams, who beat several players with ease, and finished with a powerful angled run from lock Cockbain.
"It was very hard to follow last year's extremely successful list, but we think this year's books will do even better," said Richard and Judy executive producer Amanda Ross.The 10 authors shortlisted for a Richard and Judy book award in 2005 are hoping for a boost in sales following the success of this year's winner.The best read award, on Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan's Channel 4 show, is part of the British Book Awards."There's no doubt that this year's selection of book club entries is the best yet.The TV couple's interest in the book world coined the term "the Richard & Judy effect" and created the top two best-selling paperbacks of 2004 so far.
Yantai State Asset Management Bureau - a government agency in the north-eastern city of Yantai - owns 55% of Changyu.The consumption of wine in China is still low, at just 0.22 litres per capita, said the US Agriculture Department.Italy's Illva Saronno has agreed to buy 33% of Changyu, the largest wine maker in China.Chinese wine sales are growing, the US Agriculture Department said, with wine sales in 2003 up 25% at 61.1bn yuan.The Italian liqueur maker will acquire the shares from the Yantai State Asset Management Bureau.
Mr Sullivan is at the centre of the government's case against Mr Ebbers.However, on Monday Mr Sullivan named Mr Ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud.Mr Sullivan, WorldCom's former number two, is the government's chief witness in its case against Mr Ebbers.Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers.Mr Ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud.Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants.Mr Ebbers has denied multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud."He [Ebbers] has got a hands-on grasp of financial information," Mr Sullivan told a New York court.Mr Sullivan said his former boss knew more about accounting matters than many chief financial officers and described him as "detail-oriented".
Film star Robert De Niro has returned to the top of the North American box office with his film Hide and Seek.De Niro recently spent three weeks at the top with comedy Meet The Fockers, which was at number five this week.Oscar best-picture nominee Sideways entered the top ten for the first time in its 15th week of release.Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby led the Oscar hopefuls with $11.8m (£6.3m), coming in at number three during its first weekend of wide release.The Aviator, a film biography of Howard Hughes that leads the Oscar field with 11 nominations, was at number six for the weekend with $7.5m (£4m).Last week's top film, Ice Cube's road-trip comedy Are We There Yet?, slipped to second place with $17m (£9m), while Coach Carter fell two places to number four, taking $8m (£4.25m) in its third week.
The films look well transferred to DVD, though none has extras.It's a universal rule that a film can either be a superhero special effects extravaganza or it can be good.This disc covers those special effects enough but as just one part of a detailed look at the film.The other universal rule is that DVDs of superhero films will have Making Of features only about the effects.This set has the first season of Buck (Gil Gerard) and Wilma's (Erin Gray) tongue-in-cheek adventures and it's all as camp and gaudy as you remember.The US DVD has this and the more po-faced second season - and you can import it for just about the same price.The bigger omission, though, is that there are no extras.Sometimes quality comes in bulk: this set contains no less than 34 John Wayne films ranging from the Westerns and war movies to The Quiet Man.
The fight continued outside, where "one of the officers was kicked in the chest with full force by Liam Gallagher... and suffered minor injuries", they said.But police said Gallagher kicked an officer in the chest and had large amounts of alcohol and drugs - possibly cocaine - in his blood.Gallagher lost two front teeth in the fight, which led to the band abandoning their German tour.Oasis singer Liam Gallagher has been fined 50,000 euros (£35,000) after a fight in a German hotel two years ago.
The firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to December of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; £38.4m).Japanese communications firm Softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.The service, launched in December and dubbed "Otoku" or "bargain", has had almost 900,000 orders, Softbank said.The acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the Japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of December.
Former Northern Ireland minister Sir Nicholas Scott has died at a London hospice, his family has announced.As a Northern Ireland minister he dealt with education and later security where he rode out the mass IRA escape from the Maze in 1983.After leaving Northern Ireland in a reshuffle, he became a UK disability minister.Sir Nicholas was replaced as the member for Kensington and Chelsea by the flamboyant Alan Clark, after being deselected by his constituency in December 1996.Sir Nicholas claimed strong painkillers he was taking for a back problem had reacted badly with a small amount of alcohol.Sir Nicholas was a strong defender of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and was held in esteem in Dublin government and SDLP circles.Victoria, a lobbyist for disabled rights, denounced her father's actions and heaped insult on injury when she joined the calls for him to resign.
The prices were steep by a lot of people's standards but Evans said it was not deterring shoppers.Asked the reason for the sale, Evans said: "I just want to get rid of it all, it's just a headache."Martin Hellewell, who had also made a point of visiting Evans' shop, said he thought it was a great idea.Ms Detakats said she was a collector and did not mind paying £350 for the print.He added that he was not going to reveal what he was going to do with the money he was making."We'll stay definitely until Christmas and then maybe a week after that," said Evans.They plan to open every day if possible, although Evans did not know how often he would be there."Why not, if you've got stuff to get rid of it's a good place to do it," said Mr Hellewell.Broadcaster Chris Evans has begun selling thousands of his possessions from a stall in Camden Market, London.I thought it was just a load of junk.The most striking thing about many of the pieces was their sheer size."Isn't it great" was the comment on the £1,950 throne and "Bob Dylan's old sofa - honest" was written on a dark wood couch priced £4,250.Evans has taken out the stall with business partner Pete Winterbottom.Some wandered in just to browse, as they would any of the other stalls, not knowing that it belonged to Evans.
Mr Brown welcomed news that the Bill Gates Foundation and Norway are joining up to put an extra £0.53bn ($1bn ) into the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi).UK Chancellor Gordon Brown has offered £960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.If Gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra £4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, Mr Brown argued."As long as Mr Blair and Mr Brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it."Britain, France, Gavi and the Gates Foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the International Finance Facility (IFF) to the area of immunisation.Campaign groups including Friends of the Earth, the World Development Movement, and War on Want said UK government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty.
Cheadle, was joined on stage at Berlin by Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager he plays in the film, Mr Rusesabagina's wife and his extended family, who fled Rwanda and now live in Belgium.Hotel Rwanda is one of two films addressing the genocide at the 55th Berlin Film Festival, which runs until 20 February.Political thriller Hotel Rwanda was given a rousing reception by spectators at the Berlin Film Festival on Saturday.The film, showing out of competition in Berlin, is nominated for three Oscars, including best actor for Cheadle.The film is the true story of the hotel manager who saved 1,200 Tutsis from death during the Rwandan genocide.
The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which "would be significantly weakened".Sloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said.The MPs said they were "concerned" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare.The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect "kept animals" and "companion" animals by setting up a "duty of care".The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing "mutilation" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest.My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place."Anglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.Committee chairman Michael Jack said: "Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest.
Jim Lanzone, vice president of search properties at Ask Jeeves in the US, said it did not acquire Bloglines just to get a foothold in the blog publishing world.Ask Jeeves said it was not planning to change Bloglines but would use the 300 million articles it has archived to round out its index of the web.Though Mr Lanzone added that Ask Jeeves would be helping organise the database of 300m blog entries Bloglines holds with its own net indexing technology.There would be no instant sweeping changes to Bloglines, said Mr Lanzone.It would also help drive information and entries from blogs to the portals that Ask Jeeves operates.How much Ask Jeeves paid for Bloglines was not revealed.He said Ask Jeeves was much more interested in helping people find information they were looking for rather than helping them write it.Mr Lanzone said the acquisition would sit well with Ask's My Jeeves service which lets people customise their own web experience and build up a personal collection of useful links.
A range of services in Wales were affected as civil servants in Wales joined the UK-wide strike.PCS Union spokesman Jeff Evans said: "In Wales the civil service is major employer, there are more civil servants employed in Wales proportionately than in any other part of the country.Thousands of civil servants were on strike across Wales on Friday in protest at planned job cuts.The Welsh Assembly Government said: "This is a strike about national civil service issues.Across Wales, pickets were held by striking civil servants with protests in towns and cities including Cardiff, Bangor, Aberystwyth and Wrexham."Our protest is about defending jobs and also local services across the country.The action follows Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in July that 104,000 jobs would be cut, with around 6,000 of those expected in Wales.Pickets were in place across Wales, with protests around the country."I joined the civil service to provide services as well as get a decent pension, as we thought, and pay, and it's those services that are being threatened as well as our jobs.The strike, called by the Public and Commercial Services Union, was the biggest by civil servants in a decade.The worst-affected area in Wales will be the Department of Work and Pensions where 2,000 jobs are threatened.
Mr Straw, visiting Beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to China, Burma and Zimbabwe but not to North Korea, which he said had a terrible rights record.But Mr Straw insisted the EU's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted."The result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from European Union member states to China, either in quantitative or qualitative terms," Mr Straw said.The French want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to China; the Chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from Europe."UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has defended plans to end the European Union's arms embargo on China, despite opposition from the US and Japan.He said Mr Straw was "naive beyond belief" if he accepted China's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons.China has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons.Washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in China have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo.Washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that China could use to threaten its diplomatic rival Taiwan.
Southcorp said Foster's takeover offer was "opportunistic".The two companies held four days of talks after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January.Foster's said a combination of the two companies would create a global player with an "unrivalled" collection of premium wine brands.Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a "excellent strategic fit" but undervalued the company."Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company," said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn."The combination of Foster's and Southcorp will transform the global wine industry and significantly enhance Australia's competitive position on the global stage," said Trevor O'Hoy, Foster's chief executive officer.
Cable firms NTL and Telewest have both launched video-on-demand services as the battle between satellite and cable TV heats up.With both services on offer from Telewest, Mr Tveter is confident the cable firm can dent not just the viewing figures for terrestrial TV but also gain a huge competitive advantage over Sky.Telewest customers in Bristol and NTL viewers in Glasgow will be the first to test the new service, which sees a raft of movies on offer for 24 hour rental.NTL said it had not ruled out the possibility of offering a PVR but for the moment is concentrating on video-on-demand."We offer the best of both worlds and most households have an interest in having both video-on-demand and PVR," he said."Video-on-demand will offer a deeper range of content than currently exists on TV.Telewest will launch similar services later in the year.The service is similar to Sky Plus, as users can pause, fast forward and rewind content, but they cannot store programmes on their set top box - yet.For Telewest it is the beginning of a £20m investment in TV-on-demand which will also see the launch of a personal video recorder (PVR)."It allows us to demonstrate a clear competitive advantage over Sky for the first time in many years," said Telewest chief executive Eric Tveter."While Sky will remain the dominant force in UK pay TV for some time to come, NTL and Telewest seem well placed to successfully ride this second wave of VOD enthusiasm and, if marketed correctly, this could help them eat into Sky's lead," he said.The BBC is trialling a similar service, offering broadband users the chance to watch programmes already broadcast on their PC.
Japan's Honda has won a copyright case in Beijing, further evidence that China is taking a tougher line on protecting intellectual property rights.Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail.Last month the EU said it will start monitoring China, Ukraine and Russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods.Between 1998 and 2002, the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU's external borders increased by more than 800%, it said.Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem, foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small.The problem of piracy is not limited to China, however, and the potential for profit is huge.Other firms that have taken legal action in China, with varying degrees of success, include Yamaha, General Motors and Toyota.
Three senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest.Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus."What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say," Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday.The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus.Mr Walsh said there was no conflict of interest, and, if he was to launch a rival airline or join an existing competitor, "this thing happens in every business".Mr Walsh, who took charge in 2000, and his team have earned praise for turning Aer Lingus around, by cutting air fares and staff, and re-positioning it as a low-fare airline to rival Ryanair.On Wednesday Irish Transport Minister Martin Cullen said in a statement: "A conflict of interest cannot, should not and will not be allowed to arise between their current roles at Aer Lingus and their future career intentions."That decision had followed an announcement by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern - who is still considering the future of the airline - which ruled out a proposed management buy-out of Aer Lingus.
India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel.When it was set up the firm offered tickets that were 50% cheaper than other Indian airlines.Air Deccan has ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes in a $1.8bn (£931m) deal as India's first low-cost airline expands in the fast-growing domestic market.Beer magnate Vijay Mallya recently set up Kingfisher Airlines, while UK entrepreneur Richard Branson has said he is keen to start a local operation.Air Deccan was set up last year and wants to lure travellers away from the railway network and pricier rivals.The potential of the Indian market has attracted attention at home and abroad.
A third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam.More than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery.More than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information.The results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10.This was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get.The research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that Brazilians were the most likely to read spam.
A £1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid.Both Deutsche Boerse and rival Euronext held talks with the London market last week over a possible offer.However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE's managed bid process.Speculation suggests that Paris-based Euronext has the facilities in place to make a bid of £1.4bn, while its German rival may up its bid to the £1.5bn mark.The newspaper also claimed Mr Seifert was becoming "increasingly frustrated" with the pace of negotiations since Deutsche Boerse's £1.3bn offer was rejected in mid-December, in particular the LSE's decision to suspend talks over the Christmas period.Unions for Deutsche Boerse staff in Frankfurt have reportedly expressed fears that up to 300 jobs would be moved to London if the takeover is successful.
Jamie Foxx and Hilary Swank have won the Screen Actors Guild Awards for best male and female film actors, boosting their Oscars hopes this month.Swank triumphed for playing a gutsy female boxer in Million Dollar Baby.Both Foxx and Swank are now considered to be among the favourites to get Oscars - the Hollywood's ultimate prize.Swank, too, was full of praise for her director and co-star Clint Eastwood.Modest wine country comedy Sideways knocked out favourites Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator by taking the top prize for best cast performance."I bow down to you," Swank said to the 74-year-old Eastwood.Veteran actor Morgan Freeman took the best supporting actor award for playing a prize-fighter turned gym manager in Million Dollar Baby.He also praised the film director: "Thank you for Taylor Hackford for taking a chance with an African-American film.
EU member states are failing to report fraud and irregularities in EU funds on a consistent basis, the UK's public spending watchdog has said.The report said: "Member states still do not report fraud and other irregularities to the European Anti-Fraud Office on a consistent basis.It said there were 922 cases of reported fraud or irregularities in EU funds in the UK in 2003, worth £38.5m (52m euros), up from 831 cases worth £35.7m in 2002."Any fraud in other member states is potentially fraud against the UK taxpayer, given that we are the second largest net contributor to the Community," he said.The National Audit Office said although the latest figures showed reported fraud was falling, the EU still had no common definition of fraud.He added that there is generally good co-operation with member states and the anti-fraud office on specific cases of fraud, with the statistics studied by NAO providing a "good overview for planning strategic ways of detecting fraud"."The government must take the opportunity afforded by the UK presidency of the EU to press the Commission and other member states to take an equally robust stance against fraud and irregularity, and raise overall standards of financial management."
The ECB has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.Borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said.ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005.If anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar.Inflation in the eurozone, however, is estimated at about 2.3% in December, above ECB guidelines of 2%.The ECB "may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will."
In a sign that blogs are playing an increasingly key part in spreading news and current affairs, The South-East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog is also nominated in the best overall category.Voting is under way for the annual Bloggies which recognise the best web blogs - online spaces where people publish their thoughts - of the year.One of the categories that was scrapped though was best music blog.Weblogs have been nominated in 30 categories, from the top regional blog, to the best-kept-secret blog.Blogs had a huge year, with a top US dictionary naming "blog" word of 2004.The big Bloggies battle will be for the ultimate prize of blog of the year.Technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily.Three new categories have been added to the list this year, including best food, best entertainment, and best writing of a weblog.The nominated blogs are wide-ranging covering what is in the news to quirky sites of interest.There were many new finalists this year, he added, and a few that had won Bloggies before.GreenFairyDotcom, Londonist, Hicksdesign, PlasticBag and London Underground Tube Blog are the nominees in the best British or Irish weblog.
Javier Solana, EU foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other European countries.Mr Solana told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme: "[Phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it.But Home Secretary Charles Clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases.Human rights groups, top police officers and many MPs say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge.But critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services.The government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior EU politician says.Several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.The home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance.
"We are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like Next," said M&S.Stuart Rose, head of M&S, said last year its prices were too high."We have brought in quite a lot of new clothing at new price points as part of Stuart Rose's strategy of quality, style -and price," said the M&S spokesman.However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid.DrKW said the cuts are either to clear stock or could indicate a longer term "step change in pricing in certain areas" at M&S.He also said the Takeover Panel and the UK's financial watchdog the Financial Services Authority had been in touch with M&S at the beginning of the week to find out what it knew about the Paulsmeier developments.
Flanker Colin Charvis is unlikely to play any part in Wales' final two games of the Six Nations."He will not figure in the Scotland game and is now thought unlikely to be ready for the final game," said Wales physio Mark Davies.Said Wales assistant coach Scott Johnson: "We're positive about Hal and hope he'll be raring to go.Charvis has missed all three of Wales' victories with an ankle injury and his recovery has been slower than expected.Replacement hooker Robin McBryde remains a doubt after picking up knee ligament damage in Paris last Saturday.
"Everybody says that Christmas number ones are formulaic, but Gonna Have a Number One this Christmas is the first song to crack the formula and combine all these elements into one ultimate Christmas track" said Mr Roberts.Big festive hits over the years include Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas?, Slade's Merry Christmas Everybody, Wham's Last Christmas and Sir Cliff Richards' Mistletoe and Wine.The book's analysts commissioned chart prank group Moped to create the first Christmas single using the whole formula - the song is called Gonna Have a No 1 This Christmas by Moped Vs Santa.Band Aid 20's remake of Do They Know It's Christmas is set to be confirmed as number one in the charts on Sunday.
The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was "in America's interest".US officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words.But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary.Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports.At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo.Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports.European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.The European ministers' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were "generally too weak to produce a market reaction".
"Captaincy offers a challenging environment for any player, especially following in the footsteps of Lawrence Dallaglio and before him the World Cup captain, Martin Johnson.He has been a regular in the England starting line-up ever since, played in all three Lions Tests in 2001 and all but one of England's games in the 2003 World Cup.Fly-half Jonny Wilkinson has been named as England's new rugby union captain for the three November Tests.Robinson added: "There are several players in the squad I would feel comfortable in calling upon to be England captain but for me Jonny is in every way the right player to take on this challenge."It's the ambition of so many players to one day be captain of England and today I have realised a dream," he said."I'm honoured Andy wants me to be his captain, and to follow Lawrence and Martin means a lot to me as they are inspirational men who have given so much to England rugby over many years.Wilkinson, who has scored 817 points in 52 internationals, kicked the winning drop-goal in the final seconds of extra-time in England's 2003 Rugby World Cup triumph against Australia.
The ATP has announced that it would contribute the US$25,000 tournament fee to Unicef's emergency relief fund in Tamil Nadu.Moya confirmed afterwards: "I'm donating my prize money from this tournament for the tsunami victims, hoping it makes some difference to their lives.The Spaniard then donated his £28,000 prize money to relief efforts for the victims of the Asian tsunami.His contribution follows pledges by four other players to donate their prize money from the tournament, which went ahead after the 26 December disaster which has so far claimed at least 150,000 lives.
Venezuela has previously assured foreign companies with operations in the mineral rich country that it respects existing contracts.President Hugo Chavez has ordered all existing contracts with foreign firms to be examined to see if they provide maximum benefits to the country.Announcing the review of raw material production, minister Victor Alvarez said the government would seek to transfer technology, training capability and content from projects with foreign partners.Venezuela is to review all foreign investment in its mining industries in an effort to strengthen its indigenous industrial output.Chavez has sought to extend the state's role in all sectors of the economy.However, the government insisted that it needed to develop its own industrial infrastructure in order to create new jobs and lessen its reliance on foreign partners.
For me, it was clearly out," Rochus said.Rochus was leading 5-4 in the second set tiebreak but his concentration was ruffled by a disputed line call and the match slipped away."It feels like home for me, because Jaslyn lives here," said Johansson.
UK Athletics has agreed a new deal with adidas to supply Great Britain squads of all ages with their kit for the next four years.This week, UK Athletics also agreed a four-year deal with energy drink company, Red Bull, who will be supplying the product to athletics at major domestic meetings and in high performance centres.UK Athletics chief David Moorcroft said: "The Athens experience can now be extended to more major championships.
The fourth album from the rap star was on sale for two days before it outsold all of its rivals.Eminem performed on HMS Belfast on Friday, which is docked on the River Thames, where he filmed two songs for BBC One's Top of the Pops.Eminem's latest album soared to the top of the US chart after just three days on sale in record shops.Rapper Eminem is to play an intimate gig in London on Saturday, following a show on the River Thames on Friday.The US star will play just two songs at a night showcasing his label Shady Records at the Islington Academy.The rapper was criticised earlier this year after a performance on BBC One's Top of the Pops in April led 12 viewers to complain he was "lewd" and "offensive".
And he asked why the government was agreeing to the measure on asylum and immigration now when the whole issue was part of the EU constitution, which voters in the UK had been promised a referendum over."If we don't like what other EU countries do on immigration and nationality we have the right to opt-in or out to suit the British people," he said.He argued closer co-operation with Europe over asylum and immigration was crucial to controlling the flow of people into the UK.Tory spokesman David Davis told MPs the UK was losing its power of veto over who was allowed to come to Britain.Mr Blunkett told MPs the UK would still be able to reject proposals on immigration it did not agree with.Mr Davis said once Britain had opted into policies then it could not opt out - leaving the UK open to unfavourable interpretations of what those policies actually meant."The Liberal Democrats have long argued that Britain should be a safe haven for asylum seekers but it's right that we don't do this in isolation.""By confusing the country it hopes no one will notice the disappearance of the asylum and immigration veto."David Blunkett has been accused of using the "politics of confusion" to disguise new EU immigration measures.He accused the government of being "pathetic" when it came to its efforts over immigration and asylum and of "surrendering" on the issue.
US firm Vonage also offers a Voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls.Rich Templeton, the head of giant chip maker Texas Instruments, has given his backing to the growing sector of Voice over Internet Telephony (Voip)  Voip allows PC users, and in some cases those with just a broadband connection, to make telephone calls via the net.Subscribers to Wanadoo's broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any UK landline, and free calls at any time to other Wanadoo users.Internet service provider Wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the UK.Mr Templeton said Voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes."Voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access," he said.The service will cost an extra £4 a month and will come with a free Livebox, the broadband hub which Wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services.Skype lets people make free calls to other Skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers.Almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the Skype Voip service, according to the net telephony firm's website."We can help mass-market adoption of Voip," said AOL chief executive Jonathan Miller.
In revised proposals from the Sentencing Guidelines Council (SGC), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be "weighed carefully" by a judge so they did not lead to "an inappropriately short sentence".The guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.Director of Public Prosecutions, Ken Macdonald QC, who sits on the SGC, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament.Where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.At the time Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected."What the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process.
The Movie Association for America's (MPAA) free Parent File Scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs.The body that represents the US movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing, aimed at parents.It will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive.The industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the US, but did not say how many were being sued.Mr Glickman said that the film industry was embracing "digital age technologies", like Movielink and CinemaNow, which are legal movie sites.The MPAA said files found would not be passed on to it.The first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the US in January.
Mr Blair said the statement was a "fair summary" of Lord Goldsmith's opinion.On Thursday, Lord Goldsmith said his statement had not been "written by or at Number 10".Former minister Clare Short, who resigned from the government over the Iraq war, said it was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action.But a short statement about Lord Goldsmith's position was presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 March 2003 - just before a crucial Commons vote on the military action.This is argument was rejected by Mr Blair, who said: "Firstly, we haven't broken the precedent, and secondly Peter Goldsmith has made his statement and I have got absolutely nothing to add to it.""That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I say.Lord Goldsmith has denied being "leaned on" and says the words written were his.In a book published this week, Philippe Sands QC, a member of Cherie Blair's Matrix Chambers, says Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution sanctioning military action.Mr Sands' book suggests it was actually written by Home Office Minister Lord Falconer and Downing Street adviser Baroness Morgan.Mr Mates added: "We discovered that there were two or three occasions in the past when law officers' advice to the government has been published.
But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying.Mr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up.The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged.He said: "There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa.
Nintendo's DS handheld game console has officially gone on sale in Europe.About 130 games for the DS are in development.Games for the DS are expected to cost between £19 and £29.A "download play" option means DS owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game.The DS spearheads Nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.Part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the DS can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld.Five Virgin megastores and 150 Game shops were expected to open early on Friday morning to let people buy a DS.As well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the DS also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless.
Mr Brown told the House that government policy is to raise fuel duty at least in line with inflation each year to fulfil environmental commitments."But this financial year because of the sustained volatility in the oil market I propose to match the freeze in car vehicle licence duty with a continuation on the freeze on the main road fuel duties."He said: "It is our policy that each year fuel duties should rise at least in line with inflation as we seek to meet our targets for reducing polluting emmissions and fund our public services.But this financial year, because of "volatility in the oil market", he said the duty would be frozen.Chancellor Gordon Brown has announced a freeze on fuel duty in his pre-budget speech to the Commons on Thursday.

Ms Jowell complained of the "scale of misrepresentation" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched.The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Tessa Jowell, has hit out at critics of the Gambling Bill.Ms Jowell will set out her position when the Bill is debated in the Commons on Monday.In prime minister's questions last week Tony Blair assured Parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.They are in it to fill their boots," Mr Pound told the Today programme.She told the Guardian newspaper there would be no "Las Vegas-style" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press.
The Higher Education Funding Council for England said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000.The group which represents university vice-chancellors, Universities UK, said the new system of deferred fees in England, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education.Instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said.The Higher Education Minister, Kim Howells, said: "We are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."Teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.The Hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%.The shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, said: "It is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education.Higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education.He said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late.The report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994.
Ruddock says the players will benefit from the rest, and their absence will give youngsters a chance to impress.Ruddock, though, is keen to protect his players from injury and fatigue.The Ospreys and Scarlets say they are happy to support the Wales cause, but the Dragons have expressed disappointment at not being able to use their national squad players in Friday's game with Ulster.The majority of Ireland and Scotland players have also been released for provincial duty.Ceri Sweeney, Gareth Cooper, Ian Gough and Kevin Morgan have been used sparingly by Ruddock in the opening two Six Nations wins and captain Jason Forster believes they would benefit from a game with the Dragons."Once we're in the Six Nations, the players will only be released in his and the WRU's best interests.""And the supporters want to see the star players - no disrespect to the other guys - performing on the pitch."
But, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble.Armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name.Fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a USB slot and sucking down customer files.The Financial Services Authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data.And just last week the online bank Cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name.After all, I bank with Cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that I did not even consider it when I heard about their security problems.And as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details.The real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst Bill Thompson.The fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities.Whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused?Any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the Data Protection Act and must take proper care of it.The two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft.I doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future.In fact I do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.
Curbishley said after the 4-0 win: "There was talk about Norwich being interested in the summer but I have a lot of faith in Jonatan.Curbishley was subjected to criticism from Charlton fans recently, and he said: "The thing about this club is that we have got where we are by all pulling in the same direction."When there was talk of other clubs I just told him he was going nowhere.
They would argue that, by the time of the election after next, the Liberal Democrats may genuinely have replaced the Tories as the party challenging Labour for power.He was also happy to offer a pledge that he would be doing no deals to "prop up" either of the other big parties after the election.On the war on Iraq, identity cards, student fees and the council tax, there was nothing to chose between the two big parties whereas the Liberal Democrats offered costed, sensible alternatives.But the Liberal Democrats are entering the expected 2005 election campaign determined to prove it is they, not the Tories, who are now the real threat to Labour.And he can produce some pretty impressive recent election results to back up his optimism for an election which he believes might just see his party doing big things.There was a time when such optimistic sounds coming from the third party could be dismissed as self-delusion.But Mr Kennedy believes his new manifesto will also offer sensible, costed and achievable policies on things like the council tax, crime and asylum that will underpin his claim that his party really is the only opposition worth the name.The gap between Labour and the Tories was now so narrow - as proved, he claimed, by the defection to Labour of Robert Jackson - that only his party offered a genuine alternative.He will not talk about the big breakthrough, although there are those who believe this could well be the election that sees his party crossing some sort of symbolic threshold.
Still basking in the relatively recent glory of last year's Sands Of Time, the dashing Prince of Persia is back in Warrior Within, and in a more bellicose mood than last time.Warrior Within is a very slick package; the game's intro movie is so phenomenally good that it actually does an ultimate disservice once the game itself commences.The only way to dispel it is to turn back the clock again and kill the sultry Empress Of Time before she ever creates the Sands of Time that caused the great beast's creation.Those flashy moves are back in full evidence, and tremendous fun to perform and perfect.That in turn can mean getting set back an annoyingly long distance, for you can only save at the fountains dotted along the path.There is something strangely unsatisfying about the game.It just does not quite take the character to the new heights that might have been hoped for.Ever since the series' then-groundbreaking beginnings on the Commodore Amiga, Prince of Persia has always been about meticulously-animated acrobatic moves, that provide an energetic blend of leaping preposterously between pieces of scenery and lopping off enemies' body parts.It is on a par with the jaw-dropping opening sequence of Onimusha 3 earlier this year, and when the game begins, it is something of an anti-climax.That said, the graphics are excellent, and indeed among the most striking and satisfying elements of the game.
Mozilla browsers - including Firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share, the figures suggest.While IE's market share has dropped 5% since May to 88.9%, Mozilla browsers - including Firefox - have grown by 5%.Net traffic monitor, OneStat.com, has reported that the open-source browser Firefox 1.0, released on 9 November, seems to be drawing users away from IE.Firefox is made by the Mozilla Foundation which was set up by former browser maker Netscape in 1998."It seems that people are switching from Microsoft's Internet Explorer to Mozilla's new Firefox browser," said Niels Brinkman, co-founder of Amsterdam-based OneStat.com.Microsoft IE has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from Netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark.Other browser software, like Opera and Apple's Safari, are also challenging Microsoft's grip on the browser market.Firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005.Supporters of the open-source software in the US managed to raise $250,000 (£133,000) to advertise the release of Firefox 1.0 in The New York Times, and support the Mozilla Foundation.
Entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson's US TV show, The Rebel Billionaire, is proving a flop in the ratings.But Fox has said it plans to stick with Branson's show throughout its 12-episode run.The Rebel Billionaire has marketed itself as a less materialistic version of The Apprentice, with Sir Richard shown jumping out of a taxi, while Trump is seen in a limousine.Contestants on Sir Richard's show are confronted with business tasks to solve, similar to The Apprentice.The Rebel Billionaire has averaged five million viewers and is 91st in the rankings of all prime-time shows.
But the group says hunting will continue in some form after the ban comes in, with hunts expected to test the new law to its limits.The alliance says hunt supporters will go out and test this law to its limits on Saturday.But it says the ban is unenforceable because the law is unclear and impossible to police.The decision on how to police individual hunts will be left to local forces, with more officers sent to hunts where disruption is expected.Others are expected to defy the ban by continuing to hunt illegally.The League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA say they will monitor hunts and assist police in bringing prosecutions.The Countryside Alliance had its latest legal bid to block the ban thwarted on Wednesday when the Appeal Court ruled the Hunting Act was lawful.She said many people did not share the Countryside Alliance's optimism that hunting would be able to continue.At the headquarters of Quorn hunt in Leicestershire, feelings were running high as hunt enthusiasts prepared for their final legal hunt.
An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try.A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer.The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors.Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost.Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.It could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O'Gara penalty midway through the first half.Murphy, Horgan, O'Driscoll, D'Arcy, Hickie, O'Gara, Stringer, Corrigan, Byrne, Hayes, O'Kelly, O'Connell, S Easterby, Leamy, Foley.A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks.When they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy.
Ground crews at US Airways, the seventh-largest US airline, which is now in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, face a court-imposed pay cut next month.There was also a shortage of US Airways flight attendants, with nearly a fifth saying they were too sick to work, leading to many flight cancellations.The US government is to investigate two airlines- US Airways and Delta Air Lines' Comair subsidiary - after travel chaos over the Christmas weekend.US Airways ended up cancelling over 100 flights on Christmas Day, stranding passengers in as many as 119 airports.Analysts said the Christmas chaos cast doubt on US Airway's ability to emerge from bankruptcy - and was likely to worsen the finances of troubled Delta, parent of Comair.US Airways had to cancel approximately 65 flights on Thursday, 180 on Friday, 140 on Saturday, 43 on Sunday and 15 on Monday, said industry officials.Staff calling in sick at US Airways and computer failures at Comair left 30,000 passengers stranded and 10,000 pieces of baggage undelivered.US Airways is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in two years, and battling to cut costs.Disruptions to flight schedules could discourage customers from flying with US Airways, reducing revenues.
The study, which claims to be the most in-depth so far conducted, found 60% of women in the film industry hold degrees, compared with 39% of men.It also found that women in the industry were less likely than men to be married or have dependant children.Only 16% of women earn more than £50,000, compared with 30% of men.Women in the UK film industry earn less than their male counterparts despite being better qualified, according to a study released on Wednesday.UK Film Council chief executive John Woodward said: "Whilst the UK has benefited hugely from its highly-qualified film production workforce there are still many barriers facing people who want to get in and stay in the industry."Whilst 17% of men in the industry had no qualifications, this was true for only five per cent of women.
Mr Schroeder also called for heads of government to play a larger role in shaping reforms to the pact.Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria.Mr Schroeder - a staunch supporter of the pact when it was set up in the 1990s - said exemptions were now needed to take into account the cost of domestic reform programmes and changing economic conditions.Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact.Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms.Deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several "mandatory criteria".German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called for radical reform of the EU's stability pact to grant countries more flexibility over their budget deficits.

He said it remained justified because less EU farm money came to the UK.But a UK Government official responded: "Even with the rebate, the UK pays two and a half times more than France contributes to the EU budget.Earlier Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the UK was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by Margaret Thatcher in 1984.Mr Straw has said the EU commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget.UK Independence Party leader Roger Knapman said the rebate was "set in stone" and there was no reason to negotiate about it.Mr Straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the UK wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions."The UK is already one of the biggest net contributors to the EU ."The UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Sweden want the EU budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the European Commission has urged an increase to 1.26%.Earlier Conservative Graham Brady said the rebate was a "crucial test" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for Britain."European countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods," he said.Speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the EU would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances.The foreign secretary meanwhile said the "justice" of the rebate remained."In countries like Germany and France, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in," he said.Shadow Europe minister Mr Brady said: "I believe it is essential that Britain keeps the rebate and I think it's a crucial test of how firmly the British government is prepared to stand up for Britain internationally in Europe.
EA said the video game industry was now bigger than the music industry.Mr Florin said that more than 50% of all EA's games were sold to adults and played by adults, but the perception remained that the video game industry was for children.Mr Bolz said video games firm had to work more closely with celebrities.Video game giant Electronic Arts (EA) says it wants to become the biggest entertainment firm in the world.Jan Bolz, EA's vice president of sales and marketing in Europe, said the firm was working to give video games a more central role in popular culture.He said the company was in advanced stages of discussions over a reality TV show in which viewers could control the actions of the characters as in its popular game The Sims."People will want to play video games if their heroes like Robbie Williams or Christina Aguilera are in them."Mr Florin said the challenge was to keep people playing in their 30s, 40s and 50s.He also said EA was planning an international awards show "similar to the Oscars and the Grammys" which would combine video games, music and movies.He said it would take many years before EA could challenge Disney - which in 2004 reported revenues of $30bn (£16bn) - but it remained a goal for the company."You can't ignore an industry when people queue to buy a game at midnight because they are so desperate to play it," he said, referring to demand for titles for such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Halo 2.
"On my returns, I was standing in more and I'm getting a little more depth, even if I don't hit a perfect return."Andy Roddick will play Cyril Saulnier in the final of the SAP Open in San Jose on Sunday.The Frenchman twisted his ankle early in the second set but overcame Melzer, who was left fuming over a series of line calls, 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-3.Saulnier will move into the world's top 50 for the first time after his passage through to the final."I was feeling horrible earlier in the week," Roddick said."It's taken a lot of work and a lot of fighting in my mind," he revealed.I'll keep fighting and work a lot and I'll be up there."
"We need at least $20bn (£10.6bn) in investment and part of this has to come as foreign direct investment," said Mr Maran.Potential foreign investors will however need government approval before they increase their stake beyond 49%, Mr Maran said.Communications Minister Dayanidhi Maran said that there is a need to fund the fast-growing mobile market.India has raised the limit for foreign direct investment in telecoms companies from 49% to 74%.Investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that India's mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007.

Mr Knapman rejected the idea Mr Kilroy-Silk posed a threat to UKIP and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party."He has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the (European) election it became clear that he was more interested in the Robert Kilroy-Silk Party than the UK Independence Party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'," Mr Knapman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.On Thursday, the party challenged Mr Kilroy-Silk to stand down as an MEP so voters can get a genuine UKIP candidate."The party is going nowhere and I'm embarrassed with its allies in Europe and I'm ashamed to be a member of the party," said Mr Kilroy-Silk.Mr Kilroy-Silk also told Sky News there was "masses of support" for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen.The MEP said he was ashamed to have joined the party, which he labelled as a "joke".Ex-chat show host Robert Kilroy-Silk has quit the UK Independence Party and accused it of betraying its supporters.UKIP won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the European elections on the back of its call for the UK to leave the European Union In his speech, Mr Kilroy-Silk says the result offered UKIP an "amazing opportunity" but the party's leadership had done nothing and "gone AWOL".Mr Kilroy-Silk accused his fellow UKIP MEPs of being content with growing fat "sitting on their backsides" in Brussels.

"What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister."On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was "just a cock-up" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14.Mr Kennedy said: "Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world.He said he was certain MPs would get another chance to vote against the plans.Speaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: "People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.""We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party," he said.Unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no "glass ceiling" to its ambitions.Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament.The Liberal Democrats will present themselves as "the real alternative" in the forthcoming general election campaign, Charles Kennedy has said.Your vote was wasted.
Against the yen the dollar was trading down at $103.05.The US dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in 2005.The dollar slid to a record $1.3666 versus the euro on Thursday, before bouncing back to $1.3636.Disappointing economic reports dented the currency, which had been rallying after European policy makers said they were worried about the euro's strength.The yen, meanwhile, dropped to 141.60 per euro in afternoon trading.Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was "absolutely worrying" for Italian exports.Earlier on Thursday, the Japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in Asia.
The first Visual Radio service in the UK will begin in a few months time with Virgin Radio, who are positive about the impact it could have on their listeners.Finnish handset giant Nokia has been working on a technology called Visual Radio, which takes an existing FM signal from a radio station and enables that station to add enhancements such as information and pictures.One problem is that the name Visual Radio leads people to think of television but Reidar Wasenius, a senior project manager at Nokia, was adamant that Visual Radio should not be confused with the more traditional medium."Basically, Visual Radio is not really revolutionary, but rather an evolution where we are providing tools with which people can participate in radio much more easily than ever before."That visual channel is run from a computer within the radio station, and sends out different kinds of information to the handset depending on what you are listening to."If you have a Visual Radio enabled handset, when you hear an artist you don't know, or there's a competition or vote that you'd like to participate in, you pull out your handset and with one click you turn on a visual channel parallel to the on-air broadcast you've just been listening to."As the Visual Radio content is transmitted by existing GPRS technology you would need to have that service enabled by your network.As well as details on the track or artist of a particular song, there is also the ability to interact immediately with the radio station itself, in a similar way to digital television's "red button" content.Station manager Steve Taylor commented: "Listeners can interact with the radio station in a new way.Initially Visual Radio functionality will be limited to two Nokia handsets due out soon - the 3230 and 7710 - but if successful, it is very likely that other manufacturers will want to join them.
And Hodgson believes a winter break would be a positive step in the Premiership.In Italy the break was very short."The break gives them a chance to recover that energy and enthusiasm and, perhaps more importantly, recover their mental strength during the break and get ready for the games ahead.He said: "If we talk about football at elite level, which the Premiership is, then I would support a winter break.Hodgson believes a winter break carries many advantages, explaining: "As I said, it is the perfect chance to recharge batteries.Hodgson added: "The length of breaks can vary.Former Blackburn boss Roy Hodgson says the Premiership should follow the rest of Europe and have a winter break - but insists that a gruelling domestic schedule will not damage the English elite's bid for Champions League glory.Hodgson is a fierce advocate of the winter break employed throughout Europe, although not in England - where the Champions League contenders have ploughed through a heavy fixture list."The bigger discussions around the winter break should be to do with the nature of football today, the needs of football players and the way the Premiership has developed, rather than one or two matches in the Champions League in February.""If you examine the demands of the Premier League and, in particular on players who play international football for their club and country, then a break would do them the world of good - physically and mentally."
Sony Pictures, responsible for hits like Spiderman 2 and The Grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year.Ticket sales at the US box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002's all-time high.Although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices.Warner Inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with Disney at number three.This year some of the biggest hits such as The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.Jeff Blake said: "We had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with Grudge."

Up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby failed to trim their credits - so the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences (Ampas) has done it for them.At the Golden Globes, Mr Evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with DiCaprio, director Martin Scorsese, Mr Mann and Mr King.The Oscars organisers have picked two of The Aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.But he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film Oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees.Ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after Shakespeare in Love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards.The Aviator's nominated producers are Michael Mann and Graham King - with Mr Evans and Sandy Climan, Mr Mann's former deputy, left off.
