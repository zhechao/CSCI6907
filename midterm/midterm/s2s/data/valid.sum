At least three people from Scotland died in the tsunami disaster and a further three are on the missing list, the first minister has told MSPs.He said he was proud of the generous response of people in Scotland to the disaster appeal, which is expected soon to top £20m.But he said Scotland was "in it for the long term" with help planned for fishing communities, for children's services, and for the aid charities.Mr McConnell went on to promise that Scotland would play its part in the reconstruction effort.Mr McConnell went on to signal that the executive would play its part in the Make Poverty History campaign being mounted by a variety of aid charities, trade unions and churches in the run-up to the G8 summit in Gleneagles in July.He said 2005 must be the year that Scotland showed clearly it cared for what happened to people elsewhere in the world, whether in Asia or in Africa.
On an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought.A common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.Revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter.Japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to September, figures show.
Carib Chief Charles Williams said talks with Disney's producers revealed there was "a strong element of cannibalism in the script which cannot be removed".The Caribbean island's government said Disney planned to film in Dominica.Plans to portray Dominica's Carib Indians as cannibals in the sequel to hit film Pirates of the Caribbean have been criticised by the group's chief.Mr Williams said he had received support from indigenous groups around the world in his efforts to have cannibalism references removed from the film.The first Pirates of the Caribbean film took $305m (£162m) at the box office in the US alone.He said some did not "understand our history, they are weak and are not committed to the cause of the Carib people".
It was the only title to win twice, winning Ultimate Game of the year and best PC game at the awards, presented by Little Britain star Matt Lucas.Its release was somewhat eclipsed by Doom 3, which was released on the same week.The original Doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3D graphics.Doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (£8.3m).The much-anticipated sci-fi horror Doom 3 shot straight to the top of the UK games charts on its release in August.The top honour for the best online game of the year went to Battlefield Vietnam.The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay was handed the Unsung Hero Game of 2004.
Argentina is set to close its $102.6bn (£53.51bn) debt restructuring offer for bondholders later on Friday, with the government hopeful that most creditors will accept the deal.By 18 February, creditors holding $41bn - or 40% of the total debt - had accepted the offer.The country has been in default on the $102.6bn - based on an original debt of $81.8bn plus interest - for the past three years.About 70% to 80% of bondholders are expected to accept the terms of the offer.Argentina defaulted on its debt three years ago, the biggest sovereign default in modern history.The estimated loss to bondholders is up to 70% of the original value of the bonds, yet the majority are expected to accept the government's offer.
G Murphy; S Horgan, B O'Driscoll (capt), K Maggs, T Bowe; D Humphreys, G Easterby; M Horan.The other changes see recalls for backs David Humphreys, Kevin Maggs and Guy Easterby with Eric Miller, Marcus Horan, Donnacha O'Callaghan and Frank Sheehan all returning to the pack.O'Sullivan said the players coming in had the opportunity to stake claims for inclusion against Argentina on 27 November."We have got to get the focus right on the day," said Ulster man Humphreys.Easterby gets a rare start at scrum-half while Humphreys, now effectively Ronan O'Gara's deputy at fly-half, wins his 65th cap.F Sheahan, J Hayes, D O'Callaghan, P O'Connell, S Easterby, D Leamy, E Miller.The Irish line-up shows nine changes from the team which started against South Africa with winger Tommy Bowe and flanker Denis Leamy making their international debuts."Their coach Tom Billups will have them very organised," said O'Sullivan.
Mr Brown also wants other G8 nations to match his target for overseas aid - spending 0.7% of national income."That is why next year is a test," he said.Mr Brown said much had been achieved on issues such as debt relief in the last seven years.The report said the G8 of top industrialised nations had agreed in 1970 to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid.But Band Aid founder Bob Geldof in July said he was sick of hearing "guff" about scars on the world.Mr Brown said America too needed to take more action but defended President George Bush for guaranteeing resources to countries which introduced reforms to tackle corruption.Mr Blair, who has described Africa as a "scar" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his G8 priorities along with climate change and the Aids epidemic.Next year will be "make or break" for development in poorer countries Gordon Brown will say as he sets out UK goals for its EU and G8 presidencies.It was pathetic that Britain was the 4th richest country in the world but only the 11th most generous aid donor, he added.His proposals were effectively a new "Marshall Plan" for the world, including an international finance facility, which would issue bonds in an attempt to double global aid cash to $100bn a year.Oxfam's Paying the Price report this week said 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels.
Climate change could be completely out of control within several decades, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency is warning a committee of MSPs.The evidence is part of the committee's inquiry into the impact of climate change in Scotland.Sepa predict that the two methods will remain as energy sources until climate change is under control.Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands and Southampton have been looking at wave heights in the Atlantic over the last nine years.Officials believe nuclear energy and wind farms may be better options than trying to tackle global warming.Experts are giving evidence on the subject to the Scottish Parliament's environment committee.
New targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in England and Wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.Lord Falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from Parliament.Lord Falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years.Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence.The plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses.The person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the House of Lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either House of Parliament."Courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant."Launching the Department for Constitutional Affairs' plan, Lord Falconer said: "One of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims.
A US TV network is being sued for $2.5m (£1.3m) by a viewer who says he was disgusted by watching contestants eat dead rats in a stunt show.A spokesman for NBC said it had no comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed the stunt show did feature a rat-eating scene in New York's Times Square on 8 November.The hand-written, four-page lawsuit said: "To have the individuals on the show eat and drink dead rats was crazy and from a viewer's point of view made me throw-up as well as another in the house at the same time."He said watching the show caused his blood pressure to rise so high that he became dizzy and light-headed.
Digital music players will be behind this market growth said Jupiter .The report concluded that the driving force behind the growth of Europe's portable player market was likely to be music, rather than films or any combination of the two.Mr Fogg said portable video players were likely to remain a niche product that would not be able to compete with devices dedicated to music playback."Dedicated music players are the only established digital media players in Europe today despite their high prices," said Ian Fogg, Jupiter analyst.By contrast, almost a third are interested in listening to music on a portable player such as an iPod.Barely 5% of those questioned said they wanted a player that could play back both music and movies.The report showed that 27% of consumers asked are interested in portable music players.Apple's iPod was launched in October 2001, but the portable music player market has been growing steadily since the launch of the Creative Nomad Jukebox in mid-2000.
England coach Andy Robinson said he was "livid" after his side were denied two tries in Sunday's 19-13 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin."I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey," said Robinson."We've got to go back to technology."We did everything we could have done to win the game.Kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when Josh Lewsey took the ball over the Irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try.England have lost their first three matches in this year's Six Nations and four out of their six games since Robinson took over from Sir Clive Woodward in September."We have done everything but win a game of rugby, but Ireland are a good side.They defended magnificently and they've got every chance of winning this Six Nations."There's two tries we've been cost," Robinson told BBC Sport.South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather.
Aragones' "no comment" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as Marca focuses on the Spanish coach's praise for his players.This hasn't happened in the Spanish league and Spain for many years," said Spanish Federation press officer Fernando Garrido.But what did the Spanish press make of the affair?Elsewhere, the Spanish media criticises its English counterparts for stoking up the racism issue.And Spanish daily ABC accuses English reporters of launching a witch-hunt against Aragones.Marca refers in passing to the booing of England's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of "ole" which greeted the long periods of Spanish possession.Controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of England's black players, Wayne Rooney's petulance and England's inept performance.On a controversial evening, AS offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: "Spanish football players played better football than the English.""What the boy in the Bernabeu did was odd... Rooney seemed intent to kick any Spanish player who approached him."England's 1-0 defeat to Spain on Wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on Thursday.But AS does cover the English reaction to the pre-match comments from Spain coach Luis Aragones, who highlighted Britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding Thierry Henry in October.
But a judge has barred Bank of America and two auditors from the case.The bank, and Italaudit - formerly the Italian arm of auditor Grant Thornton - face lawsuits and possible prosecution.A second auditor, Deloitte & Touche, has also been banned from the case.
Clint Eastwood's boxing drama Million Dollar Baby has become the new favourite to win best picture at the Oscars on Sunday.Million Dollar Baby has seven nominations while The Aviator has 11.In the supporting categories, Cate Blanchett is tipped to win for her performance as Katharine Hepburn in The Aviator, while Morgan Freeman is favourite to take home his first ever Oscar, for Million Dollar Baby.The Aviator has scored a best director nomination for Martin Scorsese, who has never won an Oscar, while stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett are both nominated for acting Oscars.According to pundits, the film has overtaken previous favourite The Aviator, with Eastwood also tipped to take the best director award.Anne Thompson of the Hollywood Reporter said that Million Dollar Baby was "heart-wrenching".Its star Hilary Swank is favourite to win best actress while Jamie Foxx is tipped to win best actor for Ray."It is the most nominated film, and the most nominated movie has won best picture 18 times out of the last 20 years.
Leicester and Saracens are believed to head the list of rugby union clubs interested in signing Farrell if he decides to move to the 15-man game.Leicester say they will not be rushed into making a bid for Andy Farrell should the Great Britain rugby league captain decide to switch codes.If he does move across to union, Wells believes he would better off playing in the backs, at least initially."I'm sure he could make the step between league and union by being involved in the centre," said Wells."At the moment, there are still a lot of unknowns about Andy Farrell, not least his medical situation.
The university's index of consumer spending fell to 94.2 in early February from 95.5 in January, which could indicate a fall in retail spending by the US public."The PPI would argue for Greenspan to continue to raise rates at a measured pace," said Joe Quinlan, chief market stategist at Bank of America Capital Management.Consumer spending accounts for 66% of US economic activity and is viewed as a gauge of the health of the economy, which is why the Michigan data is closely observed.But Ian Shepherdson, chief US economist at High Frequency Economics, said the PPI report was "much less alarming" than at first glance."The concern is that traders might interpret this big jump in the core PPI as an impetus for the Fed to be more aggressive than a measured move in moving rates," said Paul Cherney, chief market analyst at Standard & Poor's.Wholesale prices in the US rose at the fastest rate in more than six years in January, according to government data.However on Friday, it was overshadowed by the core PPI core figure, which surged 2.7% during the past 12 months, the biggest year-on-year gain in nine years.
Rinaldi told BBC Sport: "I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me.Adriano's agent Gilmar Rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker.But Rinaldi said: "I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for Adriano.Rinaldi told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: "I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano."If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer.""Parma and Real Madrid are interested but there's nothing new there.Adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season.
Argentina's Agustin Calleri beat fourth seed Jiri Novak 7-5 6-1 in a battle of former champions at the Mexican Open.Eighth seed Nadal, who picked up his second ATP title when he beat Alberto Martin in last week's Brazil Open, saw off the Argentine third seed 7-5 6-3.Calleri will face Albert Montanes in the semi-finals after the Spaniard ousted sixth seed Filippo Volandri of Italy 4-6 6-3 6-4.He now meets Argentine wild card Mariano Puerta, who followed up his win over top seed Carlos Moya by overcoming Spain's Felix Mantilla, 6-4 3-6 7-6.
He said one laptop per child could be " very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood".He said the child could use the laptop like a text book.Mr Negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious.That's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away."Nicholas Negroponte, chairman and founder of MIT's Media Labs, says he is developing a laptop PC that will go on sale for less than $100 (£53).The concept is based on experiments in the US state of Maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.However, Mr Negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in Cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops."Nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."
As his party set out detailed asylum reform plans, Mr Howard said they would help smash people smuggling gangs.Tory plans to cut immigration to the UK are not racist and will make the asylum system fairer for genuine refugees, Michael Howard has said."We need to break the link between arriving in Britain and claiming asylum," Mr Howard said.And a spokesman for European Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner Franco Frattini said the plans would contravene EU asylum policy, which meant the UK could not simply refuse to hear an asylum case.In a speech in London on Monday, Mr Howard said: "It's not racist, as some people to claim, to talk about controlling immigration far from it."The plans would help achieve a "substantial reduction" in immigration, he said, although he could not predict a figure.Mr Howard said nearly 160,000 people were settling in the UK every year - the size of a city like Peterborough.He said that only two out of 10 asylum seekers had their claims accepted under the current "unfair and inhumane" system.Liberal Democrat chairman Matthew Taylor said there needed to be a quick, fair and firm asylum system.But he said it was "absolutely disgusting" to propose a system which could turn away genuine refugees.- Withdrawing from the 1951 United Nations Convention on refugees, which obliges countries to accept people being persecuted on the basis of need, not numbers - Introduce laws to allow the immediate removal of asylum seekers whose claims were clearly unfounded because they came from safe countries or had destroyed documents - Detain asylum seekers without documents so people whose identity was not known were not able to move freely around the UK - a worry for "national security" - Stop considering asylum applications inside the UK and instead take people from United Nations refugee agency camps.
Size, whose New Forms album won the 1997 Mercury Music Prize, said gun use was "nothing to be glamorised".R&B star Beverley Knight said she sang on an anti-gun single after being "haunted" by the fatal 2003 shooting of two teenage girls in Birmingham.Size said he collaborated on the single, which was released on Monday, because he has "a bird's eye view of what's going on".Knight said the scale of the problem became clear to her after the 2003 shootings in Aston, near Knight's Birmingham home.She said she was "horrified" by the deaths of Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17.
Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in "a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward".Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a "hard right agenda".Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a "touchy-feely" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as "vacuous" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver.Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies.In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: "I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street."Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday.He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.
So far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said Mr Seagrave.Many of the gambling sites suffering DDoS attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said Mr King."It's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site," she said.Malcolm Seagrave, security expert at Energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.Once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.Bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said.Maria Capella, spokeswoman for net provider Pipex, said that when DDoS attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days."We have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together," said Mr Seagrave.Mr King said the only way to properly combat these so-called Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems."The serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail," said Ms Capella."We study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack," said Ms Capella."You can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another," said Mr Seagrave.This traffic can be hard to spot because DDoS attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.Also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of DDoS attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.
Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car.As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine.Neither will the announcement be seen as unalloyed good news in Sweden, since it reflects Saab's failure to make significant inroads into the lucrative European luxury car market."We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today," the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.General Motors, the world's largest car maker, has confirmed that it will build a new medium-sized Cadillac BLS at its loss-making Saab factory in Sweden.The car, unveiled at the Geneva motor show, is intended to compete in the medium-sized luxury car market.Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe.It will not be sold in the US, said GM Europe president Carl-Peter Forster.Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year.GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers.Doing so would remove the exposure to the weak US dollar, which is making Saabs more expensive to US consumers.It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US.
"Blinkx users do not stop using other web search systems," he said.Some of the latest to update their search systems are Ask Jeeves and Blinkx, which have both released a series of utilities that try to help people get more from the web.On average, said Mr Macklin, users conduct between five and 10 searches per day and the tools in My Ask Jeeves should stop them having to do searches twice and get to what they want much more easily.What users do with Blinkx and other desktop search engines shows that people tend to be very promiscuous in their use of search engines.By way of comparison Google's Desktop search tool catalogues search histories informally and lets people look through the sites they have visited.Mr Macklin said that too often when people use a search engine it was like the first time they ever used it, because there was no memory of what they had searched for before.Under My Ask Jeeves users can search the web or through the results they have already noted as interesting.Ask Jeeves has added the ability to "save" websites of interest so the next time a users visits the site they can search through the sites they have previously found.The variety of ways to search data was only helping users, said Mr Chandratillake and that it was likely that in the future people would use different ones for different tasks.Since Blinkx launched it has faced increased competition from firms such as Google, Copernic, Enfish, X1 and Apple all of whom now have programs that let people search their PC as well as the web."The future is all about developing your own personal web," said Tony Macklin, spokesman for Ask Jeeves.
The Manic Street Preachers release their first music since Edwards' disappearance.The band play their first concerts since Edwards' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for The Stone Roses on their UK stadium tour.Edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though.The Manic Street Preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but Edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation.By the time the band released their third album, The Holy Bible, in October 1994, Edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression.Richey Edwards, guitarist and lyricist for The Manic Street Preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 February 1995.The Manics' seventh studio album, Lifeblood, features a song dedicated to Edwards called Cardiff Afterlife.On the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer Edwards' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate.After becoming a full-time member, Edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in.A skeleton found by the River Severn is not Edwards, tests reveal.A pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the River Severn have no link to Edwards, police say.Edwards' sister Rachel makes an emotional TV appeal five years after the disappearance.Graham and Sherry Edwards fly to the Spanish island of Fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son's description has been seen in a bar called Underground.A fan says she saw Edwards in the hippy resort of Goa, India.But Edwards replaced Flicker in time for the band's self-financed debut, Suicide Alley, after designing the record's artwork.
OutKast did lose out in the contest for best album - which was won by Usher, another award favourite.They won best group, best video and best song for hit Hey Ya!R&B singer Usher won best male and best album for Confessions, while UK rock band Muse were named best alternative act and best British artists.Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington described their prize for best rock band as "quite an honour" while Muse said their win for best alternative act was "a real surprise for us".Spears was named best female, sending a message of thanks on video saying the award "means so much to me".US hip-hop duo OutKast have capped a year of award glory with three prizes at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Rome.Also competing for best group had been the Beastie Boys, the Black Eyed Peas, D12 and Maroon 5.- picked up the prize for best pop act, beating Anastacia, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams and Britney Spears.OutKast will add their awards to the four they won at the US MTV Awards in August and three Grammys in February.Eminem's group, D12, were surprise winners in the best hip-hop category, beating the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West and Nelly.And Anastacia, Britney Spears, Maroon 5 and Ludacris had been on the shortlist for best song.Usher, who performed a duet with Alicia Keys, also beat off competition from Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z, Nelly and Robbie Williams to take the best male crown.
Called Speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results.A Scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.The Edinburgh-based firm CEC has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search.Visitors to Speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine Google.Google has no connection with Speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said Mr Renton.But experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.Scottish speech technology firm CEC Systems launched the site in November."We are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB) is looking at the technology," he added.According to search engine Ask Jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net.But Julie Howell, digital policy manager at the RNIB, expressed doubts over whether Speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web.
Mr Kennedy added his party's priorities of free long-term care for the elderly, abolishing top-up fees and replacing the council tax would be funded by charging 50% income tax to those earning more than £100,000 per annum.The new £200 council tax rebate for pensioners did nothing to fix the "unfair tax", he added.The Lib Dem plan for a local income tax would benefit the typical household by more than £450 a year, with half of all pensioners paying no local tax and about three million being better off.On pensions, Mr Kennedy said it was a "scandal" that the system discriminated against women who had missed making National Insurance payments when they were having children.Gordon Brown has failed to tackle the "fundamental unfairness" in the tax system in his ninth Budget, Charles Kennedy has said.He contrasted his approach with Mr Brown's pledge in 2001 not to increase income tax.Speaking in the Commons after Mr Brown had delivered what is widely thought to be the last Budget before the general election, Mr Kennedy acknowledged that the UK was one of the most successful economies in the world.
The film's director Peter Chelsom said he was disappointed that Lopez did not attend."I'm so proud of Shall We Dance and was looking forward to visiting London," she said.Jennifer Lopez cancelled an appearance at the UK charity premiere of her new movie saying she was too ill to fly.The actress and singer dropped out at the last minute and has now cancelled all European promotion of the film Shall We Dance?She said: "I very much wanted to be in London but unfortunately I'm not well.I know it's true that she's not well because she has also cancelled her promotional tour.Co-star Richard Gere attended the event held in aid of the tsunami appeal.Gere, 55, greeted the crowd and signed autographs, accompanied by his wife Carey Lowell.
Indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the Paris Club about $48bn (£25.5bn).Mr Bakrie told the Bisnis Indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary.Indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the Paris Club group of creditors, Economics Minister Aburizal Bakrie has reportedly said.Nevertheless, one of Mr Bakrie's deputies, Mahendra Siregar, told AFP news agency that Indonesia was still considering the offer by the Paris Club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments.Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles accepted the Paris Club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little.The 19 member countries of the Paris Club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami.
The Archbishop of Canterbury said: "I am pleased that Prince Charles and Mrs Camilla Parker Bowles have decided to take this important step."But only 40% think Mrs Parker Bowles should become Princess Consort as planned after Charles becomes king.On Thursday night, Prince Charles, 56, and Mrs Parker Bowles, 57, hosted a dinner at Windsor Castle, their first public appearance since announcing their engagement.Mrs Parker Bowles has joined the prince at numerous engagements in recent years - mostly at evening events for The Prince's Trust.Mrs Parker Bowles said the prince went down on one knee to propose and added: "I'm just coming down to earth."Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles are awaiting the nation's reaction after announcing they are to be married on 8 April.Mrs Parker Bowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall after a civil ceremony to be held at Windsor Castle.Charles said he and his wife-to-be were "absolutely delighted".The marriage is likely to be a sensitive issue because Mrs Parker Bowles is divorced and her former husband is still alive.
But it was too little too late for the Cameroonians and Hearts held on to win the game and a place in the final.Hearts of Oak started the game needing a win to qualify for the final while Cotonsport only needed to avoid defeat to go through.Hearts of Oak set up an all Ghanaian Confederation Cup final with a 3-2 win over Cameroon's Cotonsport Garoua in Accra on Sunday.In the other Group B game Cameroon's  beat  of South Africa 3-2 in Douala, neither side could have qualified for the final.The win for Hearts means they will play Asante Kotoko in the two-leg final, after the Kumasi team qualified from Group A on Saturday.
I think the whole week was good for me.""I think she played a good match, a tough match, but I tried to stay in there."To come through like that in an important match feels good.Groenefeld was the more powerful player but could not match her opponent's relentless accuracy.
Germaine Greer has criticised Celebrity Big Brother's "bullying" of housemates after quitting the reality TV show.VOTE   Was Germaine Greer right to leave Celebrity Big Brother?Previous Big Brother housemates to leave before their time were Sunita Sharma and Sandy Cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.She also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking "agendas".The feminist writer and broadcaster said Big Brother had behaved "like a child rather than a parent" by taunting contestant John McCririck after denying him a cola drink.Greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against Big Brother.She said "superior" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying.DJ Lisa I'Anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while Jackie Stallone, who joined the house on Monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1.Ladbrokes spokesman Warren Lush said that the series was still "wide open", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on McCririck slashing his odds to 8-1.
MPs will be thrown out of the Commons if they use Blackberries in the chamber Speaker Michael Martin has ruled.The use of electronic devices in the Commons chamber has long been frowned on.The Speaker chairs debates in the Commons and is charged with ensuring order in the chamber and enforcing rules and conventions of the House.The £200 handheld computers can be used as a phone, pager or to send e-mails.
Record numbers of schools across the UK are to take part in a mock general election backed by the government.Michael Raftery, project manager at the Hansard Society, said: "The Y Vote Mock Elections for schools mirror the excitement and buzz of a real election, raising awareness of citizenship, and the benefits of active democracy.""By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future."The mock votes will take place around 5 May, widely expected to be the date of the general election.Some 600 schools have already signed up for the Y Vote Mock Elections 2005 run by the Hansard Society and aimed at boosting interest in politics.
Dechy said.The Belgian sports minister at the centre of the Svetlana Kuznetsova doping row says he will not apologise for making allegations against her.Eerdekens said he made the statement in order to protect the other three players that took part in the tournament, Belgian Justine Henin-Hardenne, Nathalie Dechy of France and Russia's Elena Dementieva.Dementieva is also angry and says that Dechy and herself are the real victims of the scandal."The WTA are trying to handle this problem by saying there are three victims, but I see only two victims in this story - me and Nathalie Dechy, who really have nothing to do with this.It's been too hard on me," she said.But Dechy is fuming that she has been implicated in the row.Criticised for making the announcement, he said: "I will never apologise.The Russian said she did nothing wrong by taking the medicine during the event.
BBC political editor Andrew Marr said that Mr Brown's article was "a warning shot" to Mr Blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process.Mr Blair argued that under New Labour the country had changed for the better and that was "in part" because of Mr Brown's management of the economy.Mr Blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be "central".The prime minister was asked about Mr Brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.The premier insisted Mr Brown will have a key role in Labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.Mr Blair said he was taking "nothing for granted" ahead of the vote - warning that the Tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut Labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.
Ms Clarkson's legal action, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, also accuses Mr Spector of negligence and battery, alleging he "grabbed, hit, fought with and restrained" Lana Clarkson before shooting her to death.The legal action accuses Mr Spector of murdering the actress at his LA home."However, Ms Clarkson and her family understand that the fair administration of justice takes time and in light of the numerous changes Mr Spector has made in his legal defence team over the last two years, Ms Clarkson was forced to file the action before (the statute of limitations expired) on 3 February 2005."Mr Spector, known for his work with the Beatles, has claimed that Lana Clarkson committed suicide.Music producer Phil Spector is facing legal action from the mother of the actress he has been accused of killing.Donna Clarkson, whose daughter Lana was found dead in Mr Spector's home in February 2003, is seeking unspecified damages in a civil action.
Continued obstruction of foreign investment could get in the way not only of privatisation plans, but also of Mr Khatami's hope of modestly reducing the government's reliance on oil revenues.In contrast, oil revenues were expected to fall to $14.1bn from $16bn in the year to March 2005.In an address to the Majlis, Mr Khatami predicted economic growth of 7.1% in 2005-6, up from 6.7% in the current year.Mr Khatami's second term as president ends on 1 August, making this his last budget."Current government expenditure should come from tax revenues," Mr Khatami said.Late last year, they backed a law which would give parliament a veto over foreign investment.Mr Khatami has already been blocked by parliament from reducing the subsidies on many products including bread and petrol, reducing his room to manoeuvre.
"I don't think anyone can say I have said one thing in public and done another in private.""Our work with the French government...has been hugely successful," said Mr Blunkett.David Blunkett - who has resigned as home secretary - built his reputation as a plain-speaking Yorkshire man."It would be dangerous territory if I wasn't practising what I preach which is to always accept responsibility, always accept the consequences of your actions."I foolishly thought as this was a celebrity edition it would be more relaxed than normal.""Trust, plain-speaking and straight talking is something which matters so much to me as a politician and as a man that I have decided, of my own volition, to request an independent review of the allegations that I misused my position."
What this means, said Stacey Jolna, senior vice president of TV Guide TV group, is that the way people find the content they want to watch has to be simplified for TV viewers.These set-top boxes, like the US's TiVo and the UK's Sky+ system, allow people to record, store, play, pause and forward wind TV programmes when they want.Essentially, the technology allows for much more personalised TV.With home theatre systems, plasma high-definition TVs, and digital video recorders moving into the living room, the way people watch TV will be radically different in five years' time.It means that networks, in US terms, or channels could take a leaf out of Google's book and be the search engine of the future, instead of the scheduler to help people find what they want to watch.High-definition TV sets are everywhere and many new models of LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) TVs have been launched with DVR capability built into them, instead of being external boxes.One such example launched at the show is Humax's 26-inch LCD TV with an 80-hour TiVo DVR and DVD recorder.One of the US's biggest satellite TV companies, DirectTV, has even launched its own branded DVR at the show with 100-hours of recording capability, instant replay, and a search function.All these reflect the increasing trend of freeing up multimedia so that people can watch what they want, when they want.But some US networks and cable and satellite companies are worried about what it means for them in terms of advertising revenues as well as "brand identity" and viewer loyalty to channels.With the US leading the trend, programmes and other content will be delivered to viewers via home networks, through cable, satellite, telecoms companies, and broadband service providers to front rooms and portable devices.They perhaps do not want so much of the choice put into their hands, Mr Hanlon suggested.One of the most talked-about technologies of CES has been digital and personal video recorders (DVR and PVR).
The debut album, which took the best British album title at the Brits on Tuesday, moved up seven places from number eight to number one.Last week's number one album Tourist, by Athlete, fell to number three.There are currently six re-released Elvis' tracks occupying spots in the top 40 singles chart including Are You Lonesome Tonight at number 20, It's Now or Never at number 27 and Jailhouse Rock at number 37.Their self-titled album moved from 13 to number four.The track, from their current album How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, pushed Eminem's Like Toy Soldiers from number one to number three.
The premier was responding to a challenge from Tory leader Michael Howard who said Labour would raise taxes in its post-election Budget.But Mr Howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under Labour and Tory value for money and lower taxes.Mr Blair derided Tory claims they could cut £35bn in "wasteful spending" saying the party had got its sums wrong.Labour and the Liberal Democrats have said the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services.Mr Howard told MPs that "every independent expert" from the International Monetary Fund to the Institute of Fiscal Studies had suggested the "government was spending more than it is raising and a Labour chancellor would have to put up taxes".
Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels.Last month Australia's competition watchdog said it would not oppose the purchase of WMC by Zurich and London-based Xstrata.He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at "sweetening" its offer.WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium.Australian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; £3bn) bid by rival Xstrata.Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid.On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders' best interest to reject the offer.He said WMC would pursue "value-creating options" provided by a portfolio of "world class assets".
Sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.Sun Grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by Sun.The Sun Grid relies on Solaris, the operating system owned by Sun.Some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, Sun said.Sun Microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.So-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software.
Kostas Kenteris' lawyer has called for the doping charges against the Greek sprinter to be dropped.Kenteris and compatriot Katerina Thanou were given provisional suspensions in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.Kenteris and Thanou withdrew from the Athens Olympics last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony.The lawyer added that he has proof the authorities "knew" Kenteris was in Germany at the time he was alleged to have missed a test in Chicago.Gregory Ioannidis has submitted new evidence to a Greek athletics tribunal which he claims proves the former Olympic champion has no case to answer.
Irish publishing group Independent News & Media is buying up a 26% stake in Indian newspaper company Jagran in a deal worth 25m euros ($34.1m).Meanwhile, the group made no comment about the future of the Independent newspaper despite recent speculation that Sir Anthony had held talks with potential buyers over a stake in the daily publication."2004 has proven to be an important year for Independent News & Media," said chief executive Sir Anthony O'Reilly.Group advertising revenues were up over 10% year-on-year, the group said, with overall circulation revenues are expected to increase almost 10% year-on-year.He has consistently denied suggestions that the Independent and the Independent on Sunday are up for sale.Buy it is understood that the recent success of the smaller edition of the Independent, which has pushed circulation up by 20% to 260,000, has prompted interest from industry rivals, with Daily Mail & General Trust tipped as the most likely suitor.
Former government communications chief Alastair Campbell will act as a media consultant to Sir Clive Woodward's 2005 Lions on their tour to New Zealand.Campbell, who left Downing Street earlier this year, will advise on media strategy before and during the tour.Woodward's decision to call in Prime Minister Tony Blair's former spin doctor springs from the deterioration in media relations on the last Lions tour of Australia in 2001, when New Zealander Graham Henry was the head coach."I hope I can contribute to the planning and preparation, and to ensuring the media and public get the most out of the tour itself," he said."[Alastair] will act as an advisor both in the build up to and on the tour itself."The Lions is a massive media event," said Woodward, who will be the head coach.
While pinpointing several areas in which there are difficulties in the bilateral and multilateral work with Russia, the US said the meeting was "much more efficient than we've seen for some time".Mr Johannesson also said progress "on the bilateral market access side is accelerating".His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry.But he said for Russia to make progress the government must "renew a commitment to democracy and the rule of law".Talks on Russia's proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been "making good progress" say those behind the negotiations.Some WTO members also dislike Russia's energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.
A British general election was last held in February in 1974.The last election was in June 2001.A Labour Party spokesman said the election date was ultimately a matter for Mr Blair, but he was unaware of anything to suggest it would be in February.The papers report that Alan Milburn, Labour's head of elections strategy, has played a key role in the plan for a February election, which would include a New Year advertising blitz.Most commentators have been expecting an election on 5 May.
England coach Andy Robinson insisted he was "livid" after his side were denied two tries in Sunday's 19-13 Six Nations loss to Ireland in Dublin."We've got to go back to technology."I think Mark Cueto scored a perfectly legal try and I think he should have gone to the video referee on Josh Lewsey," said Robinson."We did everything we could have done to win the game.Kaplan then declined the chance to consult the fourth official when Josh Lewsey took the ball over the Irish line under a pile of bodies for what could have been the game-winning try.England have lost their first three matches in this year's Six Nations and four out of their six games since Robinson took over from Sir Clive Woodward in September."We have done everything but win a game of rugby, but Ireland are a good side.They defended magnificently and they've got every chance of winning this Six Nations."There's two tries we've been cost," Robinson told BBC Sport.South African referee Jonathan Kaplan ruled that Cueto was ahead of Charlie Hodgson when the fly-half hoisted his cross-field kick for the Sale wing to gather.
Lib Dem Sir Archy Kirkwood, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said that when Mr Johnson had announced Mr Smith was going he got the "clear impression" the CSA chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case, and he may be seeking new employment opportunities.Tory work and pensions spokesman David Willetts said families affected by CSA failings would wonder why Mr Smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced.But committee member and Tory MP Nigel Waterson said he was "amazed" Mr Smith was still in his job.A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman confirmed Mr Smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found.Mr Smith's departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the Child Support Agency.In November, when he surprised MPs and the watching media by announcing Mr Smith's departure, Mr Johnson said: "I should tell you that Doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead.On that day's Today programme Mr Johnson was asked why Mr Smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked.Doug Smith's departure was announced by Work Secretary Alan Johnson on 17 November as MPs grilled him over the agency's poor performance.He added that he had been absolutely open when he announced Mr Smith's departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a "different thing"."No date was ever given for Doug Smith's departure," she said adding that the post had been advertised.Asked on Thursday about Mr Smith's position Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's World at One he thought it was a "non-story".
At the end of his Middle East trip, Mr Blair said he still admired Mr Blunkett and thought his integrity was intact.He said Mr Blunkett's integrity remained intact: "He was the person first of all who asked for this inquiry to be set up.Prime Minister Tony Blair said it was time to draw a line under the controversy surrounding David Blunkett.Mr Blunkett quit as home secretary last week after being told in advance of Sir Alan's findings.He said: "Next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa.On Tuesday Sir Alan said the application for leave to remain in the UK made by Kimberly Quinn's nanny was processed in 52 days, 120 days faster than the average.Earlier, Mr Howard said: "There does need to be another inquiry, a judge-led inquiry.But he could not find evidence to show whether Mr Blunkett's intervention was intended to give special help for his then lover's nanny - or if he was raising the case as an example of poor departmental performance.Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten also said there was "a strong case for a judge-led judicial review".The Tories and the Lib Dems have called for a second inquiry into the fast-tracking of a visa application for Mr Blunkett's ex-lover's nanny.
US phone company SBC Communications said it expects to cut around 12,800 jobs following its $16bn (£8.5bn) takeover of former parent AT&T.SBC and AT&T said estimated cost savings of at least $2bn from 2008 were a main driver for the merger.SBC said 5,125 positions would go as a result of network efficiencies.SBC currently employs 163,000 people while AT&T employs 47,000.AT&T is a long-distance telecoms firm, while SBC is mainly focused on the local market in the western US.
Janie Hendrix, the guitarist's stepsister, said the family were still hoping the guitarist would be honoured by having a road named after him.The foundation moved the building, in which Al Hendrix lived between 1953 and 1956, when the land it was built on was to be developed for housing in 2002.Mr Goldman said the authority had promised the house could remain on its new site and be turned into a memorial and community centre."The mayor is going to go down as the mayor who destroyed Jimi Hendrix's house," said Ray Rae Marshall of the James Marshall Hendrix Foundation.Hendrix was widely considered one of the most important guitarists of his time.Hendrix supporters hoped to turn the home into a museum for the guitarist.Now Mr Goldman is calling for the authority to pay to move the building to Seattle's central district, where Hendrix grew up.Seattle officials said no such deal had been offered.
New rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the UK are coming into force.The Home Office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year."These rules means in some cases the Home Secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort.Rhian Beynon of the JCWI said the new rules were "not proportionate" and "discriminatory".But from Tuesday all non-EU nationals, apart from citizens of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland or Norway, intending to wed in the UK must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a Home Office 'certificate of marriage approval'.Mr Rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at Brent Council in north-west London, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties.Registrars' spokesman, Mark Rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent.In a report published last July the cross-party committee stated there was a "significant risk" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were "disproportionate".The role of registrars who under the Asylum and Immigration Act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the Home Office, has been key in many prosecutions.We'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the Human Rights Court," Ms Beynon said.From Tuesday, most non-EU citizens will need Home Office approval to marry.The new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights.

"None of the 10 former directors was a direct participant in the accounting machinations of the WorldCom fraud," said the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).Ten former directors at WorldCom have agreed to pay $54m (£28.85m), including $18m from their own pockets, to settle a class action lawsuit, reports say.Corporate governance experts said that if the directors do dip into their own pockets for the settlement, it will set a new standard for the accountability of bosses, when the firms they oversee face problems."Directors very rarely pay," said Charles Elson, chairman of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.Two other outside former directors, Bert Roberts and Francesco Galesi, remain defendants in the lawsuit, said the newspaper.It has not yet been determined how much each director will have to pay.But, a spokesman for the prosecutor, New York State Comptroller Alan Hevesi, said no formal agreement had been made.
He said he was sent there after being interrogated by a British man who said he was from MI6, shortly after his arrest in Zambia in March 2002.Mr Mubanga, 32, from Wembley, London, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp.Mr Mubanga said the man, and an American female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to Guantanamo Bay.Mr Mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: "I've lost three years of my life, because I was a Muslim.In a statement, it said: "The Department of Defense has no doubt that Mr Mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war.Mr Mubanga said he had been in Afghanistan and Pakistan to study Islam.Mr Mubanga, who has dual British and Zambian nationality, was one of four Britons who were released from the US camp in January.But he said he was unable to return to the UK because he had lost his British passport, and was travelling on his Zambian passport instead.And Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved Mr Mubanga's transfer to Guantanamo.He said: "The pattern is the same.Mr Mubanga said the "MI6 agent" told him the passport had been found in a cave in Afghanistan along with documents listing Jewish groups in New York and suggested he had been on an al-Qaeda reconnaissance mission.And he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot.
The tsunami tribute song will also feature Alicia Keys, Velvet Revolver and Tim McGraw.The awards show will also feature performances from U2, Green Day, Alicia Keys and Kanye West - but the Lopez and Anthony duet is likely to be one of the biggest talking points.Singers Jennifer Lopez and husband Marc Anthony, a Latin pop star, are to perform a duet at this month's Grammy Awards in Los Angeles.Anthony became Lopez's third husband in June 2004.There will also be a tribute to Ray Charles featuring Bonnie Raitt and Billy Preston and a celebration of southern rock with Tim McGraw, Gretchen Wilson, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Dickie Betts and Elvis Bishop.He is nominated this year for best Latin pop album and best salsa/merengue album.
A Bayern spokesman said on Monday that the decision not to take Hashemian to Israel had been motivated only by his physical condition."He's got back pain and he couldn't train," the spokesman said.Iran gave judo world champion Arash Miresmaeili a $125,000 reward when he refused to fight an Israeli at the Athens Olympics.The German club said the player had pulled out because of a back injury.
Much of the collection will be offered for sale at three auctions in New York in June, with smaller contemporary paintings going under the hammer in London on 22 and 23 June.The collection was housed at Versace's six-storey New York townhouse.The art collection of murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace could fetch up to £9m ($17m) when it is auctioned in New York and London later this year.Among the pictures for sale are works by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol and Henri Matisse.
England captain Jonny Wilkinson will make his long-awaited return from injury against Edinburgh on Saturday.Wilkinson, who has not played since injuring his bicep on 17 October, took part in full-contact training with Newcastle Falcons on Wednesday.Wilkinson's year has been disrupted by injury as his muscle problem followed eight months on the sidelines with a shoulder injury sustained in the World Cup final.The 25-year-old missed England's autumn internationals after aggravating the haematoma in his upper right arm against Saracens.
Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC "may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside".Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears.Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike.The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was "concerned by the clamour in some quarters" for early interest rate increases.The Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts."Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends."
The survey also looked at issues of nationality.Many of the pupils also looked on themselves as English, Scottish or Welsh, rather than British; while the notion of being European hardly occurred to anyone.Only a quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that Labour was the government, the Tories were the official Opposition and the Lib Dems were the third party.The ICM survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog Ofsted.
Alberto Flores, president of the Spanish FA's disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt Aragones was a racist nor had "acted in a racist way.""You compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in Spain than you should," Wenger said.Aragones was handed the fine on Tuesday after making racist remarks about Henry to Arsenal team-mate and Spanish international Jose Reyes last October.The Spanish Football Federation at first declined to take action against Aragones, but was then requested to do so by Spain's anti-violence commission.Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was fined £15,000 in December for accusing Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy of cheating, believes that Aragones' punishment was too lenient.The fine was far less than the expected amount of about £22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence.However, Aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair.Spain coach Luis Aragones is furious after being fined by The Spanish Football Federation for his comments about Thierry Henry.
Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as "deeply flawed" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again.New Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to "pause for thought" from Charles Kennedy.The Home Office says people will pay £85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card."ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society," he said.The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them.He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors.But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now.If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained."Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been "significantly influenced" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.
Bath and England centre Mike Tindall believes he can make this summer's Lions tour, despite missing most of the season through injury.But Tindall, who recently signed for Bath's west-country rivals Gloucester, told Rugby Special he would be fit in time for the tour to New Zealand.But after missing out on the 2001 tour to Australia with a knee injury, Tindall says he will be happy just to have an opportunity to wear the red shirt."I've spoken to Sir Clive Woodward and he understands the situation, so I just hope that I can get on the tour."
Microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect PCs.Microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its Windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.It is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in China, Norway and the Czech Republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies Windows.The company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time.Those running pirated Windows programs would not have access to other downloads and "add-ons" that the software giant offers.The Windows Genuine Advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005.Microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating PCs.Windows Genuine Advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in September 2004 for English-language versions of Windows.Microsoft's Windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of.
Mr Hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by Symantec subsidiary Brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses.But the novel worm spotted recently by Spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place.As blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, Spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped.Spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.While the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too.In this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate.For instance, said Mr Hogan, filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.Anti-spam group Spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail.
A speech on mobile TV by Angel Gambino of the BBC also drew a large crowd, suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile TV yet are starting to look into it.Mobile operators O2 and Vodafone are among the operators trialling mobile TV.Scandinavians and Koreans, two of the most adventurous groups of mobile users, are betting on mobile TV.But all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile TV arena.Samsung of South Korea has a DMB phone too that will be one of those offered to users of the TU Media satellite mobile TV service to be launched in Korea in May.Dr Chan Yeob Yeun, vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile TV at LG Electronics, said: "DMB offers twice the number of frames a minute as DVB-H and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly."SK Telecom of South Korea, which is launching a TV to mobile service (via satellite) in May plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio.Nokia, the Finnish handset maker, is planning a party in Singapore this spring to launch its TV to mobile activities in the region.The jury is still out on whether TV and digital radio on mobiles will make much money for anyone.For those not convinced mobile users will want to watch TV on their handsets, Digital Audio Broadcasting may provide a good compromise and better sound quality than conventional radio."This will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on TV."
"And I want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots," she added."If you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future," concluded Professor Dautenhahn."We are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists," said Professor Kerstin Dautenhahn, project leader at Hertfordshire.The research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator."Without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds," Professor Dautenhahn told BBC News Online.By playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a University of Hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations.However, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the "robotiquette" for human interaction.
The net search giant Google has launched a search service that lets people look for TV programmes.Rival search engine Yahoo has been developing a similar type of video search for webcasts and TV clips which it promotes from its homepage.The service, Google Video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes.It searches for and links to TV news, film trailers, and other video and audio clips.It only searches US channel content currently.The results thrown up by the search will also include programme and episode information like channel, date and time."Over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via Google Video but don't have more product details to share with you today," a Google spokesperson told the BBC News website.It also lets people find the next time and channel where a programme will aired locally using a US zip code search function.
Mr Howard appointed Mr Crosby as his elections chief last October.Mr Crosby's statement said: "The Conservative Party has been making an impact on the issues of lower tax and controlled immigration over the past week."Mr Howard later added there was not "one iota" of truth in the report.But Mr Crosby said in a statement: "I have never had any such conversation... and I do not hold that view."
More than five million households in the UK have broadband and that number is growing fast.The Demos report looked at the impact of broadband on people's net habits.More significantly, argues the report, broadband is encouraging people to take a more active role online.The Demos report, entitled Broadband Britain: The End Of Asymmetry?, was commissioned by net provider AOL.A quarter of broadband users in Britain regularly upload content and have personal sites, according to a report by UK think-tank Demos.Fast web access is encouraging more people to express themselves online, research suggests.

A Windows virus called Bofra is turning infected machines into distributors of its malicious code.Those clicking on the poisoned links in e-mail messages sent out by infected machines may fall victim to the virus.Clearswift said that fact that no viral code travels in the e-mail messages sent out by machines infected by Bofra could hamper effects to limit its spread.Essentially, Bofra turns infected machines into small web servers that happily dole out copies of the virus.Finnish anti-virus firm F-Secure said that, so far, it had not seen many copies of the Bofra virus and its variants in circulation.Filtering firm Clearswift said this tactic of creating thousands of mini web servers was designed to help the virus spread quickly and avoid attempts to shut it down.Those clicking on the links will inadvertently download the Bofra virus which will then start searching for new addresses to send itself to.The virus uses its own mail sending software to despatch e-mail messages to potential victims but, unlike many other recent viruses, does not itself travel via mail.The virus that uses this trick is called Bofra and the first member of the family of worms appeared on 10 November.The Bofra family of viruses, which were originally thought to be offshoots of the MyDoom bug, can infect machines running Windows 2000, 95, 98, Me, NT, XP and Server 2003.
Reuters beat profit forecasts, posting a 52% rise in profits for the year to £198m from the £130m seen a year earlier.Reuters also managed to slow a decline in underlying revenues to 5.4% from 10.2% in 2003 and cut its debt back to £160m from £610m a year earlier.The news and financial data seller said the year had begun well, adding it expected "further gradual improvement" in the second quarter of the year after good January sales.It added it was planning to deliver a further £105m of savings over the coming year - but said it expects to be hit with an £80m restructuring charge to pay for the cost of moving from Fleet Street to new headquarters in London at Canary Wharf.
A Labour source told the Sunday Times Mr Campbell would "effectively front" the election media campaign but said he would be given no formal title.Ex-Downing Street media chief Alastair Campbell will return to the fold to strengthen Labour's general election campaign, the party has confirmed.Mr Campbell was at the centre of the government's row with BBC over Andrew Gilligan's story about the Iraq weapons dossier."Of course Alastair's going to be part of the election campaign and I think that all of us who will also be part of the election campaign are very pleased about that," Ms Jowell told Sky News."He is a strong Labour Party member," Mr Prescott told BBC One's Breakfast With Frost programme.Labour strategists told the paper he would be "set loose" on Conservative leader Michael Howard in attacking his party's economic record when it was in power.Since leaving Downing Street, he has toured the country with his one man show, An Audience With Alastair Campbell and presented a number of interview programmes for Channel 4.Mr Campbell has consistently made public his keenness to play a part in the poll, expected in May.
"If Mike Leigh is going to win awards for anything, it should be Vera Drake at this year's Baftas", said Mr Jolin, adding that the film was probably his most technically accomplished and lavish work yet.Out of all the films in the running for the Baftas, Vera Drake is the true blue British one.""If there is anywhere where this film is going to win, it will be at the Baftas," he said.The Guardian's film critic Peter Bradshaw felt that there "might well be" a sweep of awards for Vera Drake on Saturday night."A best director prize for Mike Leigh and best British film are also likely and it could steal some awards from heavily-nominated competitors The Aviator and Finding Neverland."Mr Bradshaw felt that Mike Leigh's "masterpiece" was entitled to the best film award - leaving Dead Man's Shoes, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, My Summer of Love and Shaun of the Dead to slug it out for the best British film trophy.Mr Jolin tipped another contender - most likely The Aviator - to walk away with the Bafta for best film, and added that Finding Neverland had been lavished with nominations but not trophies.At the Bafta film awards on Saturday night, there is the prospect that a home-grown movie could walk off with a clutch of trophies.The film has spent months being lauded with prizes, from the Venice Film Festival to five awards from the London Critics' Circle on Wednesday night.
Symbian said that the spread of the Skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself.Symbian phones produced by Sony Ericsson, Motorola, BenQ, Arima and Fujitsu are unaffected by the Skulls program.The Skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias Tee-222.The Skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.The firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again.The file, nicknamed Skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones Symbian said that it was not sure if the damage Skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming.The program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone.
But by September 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month.Mr Sunner said MessageLabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation.Other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.The number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm MessageLabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months.Older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened.In 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages.Although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals.In its end-of-year report, MessageLabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals.
The deal was sealed three days after Turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the Ukrainian economy.On Friday, Turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to Ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head.Supplies from Turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by Ukraine, which has large coal deposits but no gas fields.Ukraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by Turkmenistan.Turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.
The FSA took over regulation of the general insurance sector in January, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients.In a speech on Monday, Mr Prettejohn urged the FSA to force brokers to disclose the size of their commissions.Brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the FSA said.The head of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, has criticised Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority (FSA).All of the insurance business written in the Lloyd's market is placed via brokers."The FSA should change, and change now" said Mr Prettejohn, who wants it to move from "disclosure on request" to mandatory disclosure.
South Africa's Schalk Burger was named player of the year as the Tri-Nations champions swept the top honours at the International Rugby Board's awards."Schalk's emergence as a major force has meant a lot to South African rugby, but has also influenced world rugby," said White.Burger's award came just a week after he won the equivalent prize from his fellow international players and White, who also coached Burger at under-21 level, paid tribute to him.England player Simon Amor beat team-mate Ben Gollings and Argentine Lucio Lopez Fleming to win the sevens award.
Immigration and asylum have normally been issues politicians from the big parties have tiptoed around at election time.But, while all the parties appear to agree the time has come to properly debate and address the issue, there are already signs they will run into precisely the same problems as before.Labour has already branded the proposal unworkable but party strategists have seen the Tories seizing a poll advantage over the issue.Former union leader Sir Bill Morris has already accused both the big parties of engaging in a "bidding war about who can be nastiest to asylum seekers".The challenge for the big parties is to ensure they can engage in the debate during the cut and thrust of a general election while also avoiding that trap.That has been attacked by the Tories as too little, too late and for failing to tackle the key issue of the numbers entering the UK.That was also true at the last general election and the issue did briefly become a campaigning issue.
Poland - a large and therefore crucial EU member - has requested more time to consider the issue, especially as it relates to the patenting of software.The planned law has ignited angry debate about whether the EU should allow the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods as currently happens in the US.Critics say the law would favour large companies over small, innovative ones.Critics claim the law, which the EU says is needed to harmonise with the US, is little more than a law on ideas.The European Parliament has already clashed with the European Union on the issue and there have been accusations that the process to decide the issue has been undemocratic.
The title broke the UK sales record for video games in its first weekend of release.Although Xbox sales over the last week also climbed, PS2 sales were more than double that.Sony PlayStation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with UK gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.The sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since GTA San Andreas has an 18 certificate.The Xbox game Halo 2, released on 11 November in the UK, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year.The numbers were also boosted by the release of the PS2-only game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.The figures mean Sony is reaching the seven million barrier for UK sales of the console."Both have hit crucial price points at around £100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales," said Mr Houlihan.Microsoft's Xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales.
The Engerwitzdorf scheme is an outgrowth of Telekom Austria's online TV channel Aon which lets people watch programmes on their PC.Any video programme created by the villagers is uploaded to a Buntes Fernsehen portal that lets people browse and download what they want to watch.Aon streams a couple of live channels, plus sports, news and music programmes on to the net and has a pay-for-download section that lets people watch what they want when they want to watch it.Mr Fischer said it was taking the roll-out to other areas slowly because of the work involved in setting up the scheme, getting backers from local government and educating people how to make programmes.The Buntes Fernsehen project has been such a success that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other schemes in similarly rural areas.The pilot has been so successful that Telekom Austria is now considering setting up other projects elsewhere.In October a larger TV-on-demand project is due to launch in Vienna that will let people download many programmes from the net.Most people watch the TV on their home PC and a broadband connection is needed to get broadcast quality programmes.
Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos - with an office in Houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction.Russia's president has defended the purchase of Yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft, saying it followed free market principles.It has said it will be seeking damages of $20bn.The Rosneft announcement came just hours after Yukos accused Gazprom of illegally taking part in Sunday's auction.Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction.By selling the Yukos unit to little-known Baikal and then to Rosneft, Russia is able to circumvent a host of tricky legal landmines, analysts said.A Rosneft spokesman has said the acquisition is part of its plan to build a "balanced, national energy corporation."Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned."Everything was done by market methods," Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow.The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos, one of Russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse.Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met."The Russian government has sovereign immunity."
Despite not playing for England, Wilkinson is still hoping to make the Lions tour to New Zealand this summer.Lions coach Sir Clive Woodward has not set a deadline for when Wilkinson has to start playing again in order to be considered for selection.But Rob Andrew, coach of Wilkinson's club side Newcastle, said that with only two games left to play Wilkinson was unlikely to be fit in time.That game is the day after England play Italy in the Six Nations and six days before their final match of the championship against Scotland.England's World Cup-winning fly-half said last week he was hoping to recover from his latest injury in time to play some role in the championship.Wilkinson is aiming to make his third start to the season in the Zurich Premiership match against Harlequins on 13 March.
Mr Blunkett said he wanted "to go back to a time when I was very young, when you expected the police to be part of the community and the community to be part of policing and where people were joined together in partnership making it work".The best performing police services would get more cash and extra freedoms, he said, but he would not shirk from stepping in where the public was being failed.Mr Blunkett said a new three digit number would be created for non-emergency phone calls to police.Police forces were already "buried" under existing government initiatives and there was little in the latest plans to reassure them," said Mr Davis.Earlier Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the government was right to want to increase the links between local people and the police.He has also started to recruit 25,000 Community Support Officers (CSOs) and the new plans would allow all police forces to give them the power to detain suspects.The home secretary said targets would be put in place to ensure that the public got a good response from police.Local people would also be able to "trigger" action on specific problems if they felt nothing was being done.The plans also include the idea of allowing people join police forces at different levels rather than the traditional way of making everybody spend specific amounts of time as a constable before being promoted.Opposition parties also want more local policing to tackle nuisance behaviour and other crime but they accuse ministers of tying the police up with paperwork.
Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA).Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added.In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation.Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year."This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome," Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News.
Nadal, playing in the outdoor clay event for the first time, hit some powerful forehands to oust Starace in a match delayed over an hour by rain.Compatriot and seventh seed Rafael Nadal also reached the last eight, beating Italian Potito Starace 6-1 6-3.He will now play Gaston Gaudio, who beat unseeded Brazilian Flavio Saretta 6-3 6-2 in the day's late match.
The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price.Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business.A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products.
The new book claims Mr Prescott hosted a dinner in November 2003 where the prime minister told Mr Brown he would stand down before the next election because he had lost trust over the Iraq war.In Mr Peston's book Mr Brown is alleged to have told the prime minister: "There is nothing you could ever say to me now that I could ever believe."At a campaign poster launch on Tuesday, Mr Brown was joined by Alan Milburn, who Mr Blair controversially put in charge of election planning in place of the chancellor.Mr Blair then changed his mind in June 2004, after Cabinet allies intervened and amid suspicion the chancellor was manoeuvring against him, writes Mr Peston.On Tuesday, Deputy Prime Minister Mr Prescott told BBC News: "They told us very clearly, it was the troops telling the leaders: get in line."The prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at Monday's meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party over claims made in journalist Robert Peston's new book.Mr Brown, meanwhile, is visiting Tanzania, Mozambique and Kenya to highlight the plight of many Africans hit by Aids, war and famine - issues which Mr Blair has also spoken out on.
Spectators were evacuated from Real Madrid's Bernabeu stadium on Sunday following a bomb scare during the game between the hosts and Real Sociedad."The police have said they have completed their search and have not found anything," said Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.The Bernabeu was targeted by ETA on 1 May, 2002, when Madrid were about to play FC Barcelona in a Champions League semi-final.Real took the lead just before the break when Brazilian striker Ronaldo cracked home with his left foot.If the result remains at 1-1, Real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders Barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at Albacete on Saturday.A car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.
